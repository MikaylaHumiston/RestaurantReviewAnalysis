2024-03-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great service, delicious food, we will be back for certain!"
2024-03-17,drrobertj,5.0,loved the whole experience! wanted fresh steam clams and lobster and got that and then some. great service to the lovely greek lady .
2024-03-15,gigi,5.0,we had a lovely 85th birthday celebration for 3 generations. shea was a fabulous hostess and server. the food was versatile and delicious! we thank you for the new menu especially for 3 gluten free patrons. the desert additions were splendid. you will remain our favorite spot for special occasions! many thanks.
2024-03-10,OpenTable Diner,3.0,our wait person was fantastic! the linguini and clams was ok. the grilled cod and winter veggies (consisting mostly of undercooked carrots) were doused in oil.  now my stomach is complaining. i think the quality of their food has gone way down.
2024-03-09,MrPink33,1.0,"first bad experience in over 20 years.  ordered blackened salmon medium well with rice and fries.  the plate that came was grilled salmon undercooked.  before sending it back i asked the waitress to examine and she agreed it was wrong.  i asked for a new plate, what came back was the same piece of fish just grilled more, so dry it fell apart.  the rice was half the portion of the first plate and cold.  and the other side was asparagus instead of the fries.  i sent it back a second time and the same piece of fish came back, same small portion of rice cold, and new fries very hot.  so all they did the second third time was replace the asparagus with the fried.  the manager came over on her own as the waitress reported it to her, and the manager agreed it was completely wrong.  she offered a free appetizer which at that point i didn't want.  she offered a free dessert to take home which i didn't want as i am pre-diabetic.  she offered to discount the entree, but when the check came it was the full amount but with a 20% employee discount.  unbelievably bad all the way around.  left hungry and shocked as i never had a bad experience at any legal location until this one.  will hope the management reads this and make the necessary changes in the kitchen.   shocked and disappointed.  i'm willing to chalk it up to a bad experience and will go back to legal again, but if this ever happens again in the future i will never go back.  busy saturday night is no excuse, you can't strike out three times on the food, make meager offer of food substitute, and then discount in an insulting way."
2024-03-08,JulieD,4.0,"we had a wonderful time celebrating my husband's birthday with family and friends.  patrick is an excellent waiter, and the food was wonderful."
2024-03-08,GEORGEB,4.0,great seafood! good service. not cheap but great quality food
2024-03-07,LynneS,5.0,we had a lovely experience and particularly appreciated our server pat.
2024-03-07,Newcomer,5.0,"good food, service, ambience. better than other legal locations."
2024-03-06,JaneB,5.0,"great experience at legal seafood last night... as usual, the food was top-notch. we had a wonderful waiter - smiling jeff!"
2024-03-06,LarryP,3.0,"we showed up with a reservation for a group of 6.  they wanted us to squeeze in a circular booth maybe adequate for 4.  when i went back to teh front to explain that we do not fit or will not sit uncomfortable, the host was uncooperative explaining they were reserved (untrue as they were empty and continued empty after we left).  so after i said that we will simply not eat there, we were sat on an appropriate size circular table.  but, my experience started on the wrong note and ruined by an employee that was un-accomodating without reason.  the food experience, i will not go over it because the evening started wrong and when one pays ls prices, one expects a complete positive experience.  i will say that sean was a fantastic waiter."
2024-03-03,PeggyR,5.0,delicious fresh seafood prepared in so many creative ways or just in a traditional manner. we've been eating at legal's for decades. framingham is a great location that has become a favorite!
2024-03-02,PeeJay,3.0,food was fair. steak was very undercooked and full of gristle.  i expected a better cut cooked properly for that price.  shrimp was over cooked and rubbery.  broccoli and asparagus were both almost raw.  server was nice but inexperienced.  host staff was frazzled and unappreciative; very curt.  restrooms filthy and unstocked; plumbing broken. the quality at legal continues to spiral downward.  no longer even a mediocre chain.
2024-03-02,OpenTable Diner,1.0,for $119 we had 2 cups of chowder- 2 seafood casseroles and 2 lemonades. the menu looked like something from the 70s. the casserole wasn’t on the menu we had to ask and the took mashed potatoes off the menu!!!!! are you kidding??!! the casserole was $42 and half the size of we the original owners had. one scallop in the damn thing! for that price and no alcohol is ridiculous! won’t be back anytime soon! so disappointed!
2024-03-01,Flapper,5.0,"our waitress was awesome, attentive and very friendly.
you can’t go wrong with legal’s!"
2024-03-01,Ballou,5.0,"jeff, our server, was excellent. very attentive and helpful with food suggestions. the legal app offered a discount which made it even more enjoyable. salmon for my wife - crispy fish sandwich for me!"
2024-03-01,Foodie888,4.0,wonderful how my reservation was almost exactly at 7:00pm. the waiter was a bit curt.
2024-02-29,OttyMatic,4.0,the lobsters were great.  great taste and great price.
2024-02-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"chea, our server, was excellent!  she was prompt, professional, and fun to talk to. she did a great job of managing a very busy night."
2024-02-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,sat in the bar area and amanda was our server.  she did an awesome job!
2024-02-29,out2dine,5.0,"we visited legal seafood for their leap year day special of twin lobsters.  we’re so glad we were able to make a reservation with opentable to get in. the restaurant was very busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. the server and wait staff were very friendly and gave us excellent service. the lobsters were very delicious and some parts were pre-opened to make it easier for us. one of the managers came by our table twice to ask how we were enjoying the meal and briefly chat with us. it’s a very nice gesture for the manager to take the time to make sure everything is ok. we had about a 2 hour leisurely meal while we each ate (2) 1 lb lobsters. i would definitely recommend legal seafood and this location. it is one of our favorite restaurants and we continue to return."
2024-02-29,aceandhoney,2.0,"lobsters were dry and tasteless, as if they were previously baked (burn marks), frozen and then quickly steamed to resurrect them. this legal need a real make-over. the silver duct tape on the black bench seats has to be replaced with new seats and the splattered food residue on the wall and table lamp needs a serious clean-up. hardly an appealing dining experience. our server judy was excellent but with the other downsides we won't return until legal framingham cleans up its act."
2024-02-29,Dave,5.0,great lunch today. boiled lobster was delicious and easy to crack open. the scallops were also excellent! the service and our waitress were exceptional.
2024-02-28,israelb,1.0,"my order was bad the food cook well done burn 
scallops and the weggi was burn too"
2024-02-28,drray123,5.0,"waitress was excellent
food hot good tasting"
2024-02-27,AnthonyS,5.0,excellent wait staff and a great place to celebrate special events.
2024-02-27,Marnie,3.0,salad was great.  sushi o.k and had to request soy sauce on side.
2024-02-25,KarenB,5.0,"my husband and i were seated immediately! the waitress appeared in less than two minutes and took our drink and appetizer order which we received in a timely manner. i ordered the baked stuffed lobster stuffed with moist breadcrumbs, shrimp (were not shrimpy ) and scallops which was amazing . the lobster was sweet and tender.  my husband ordered steamed lobster and enjoyed it thoroughly. framingham legal seafood restaurant never ceases to amaze!!!!"
2024-02-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we enjoyed the food, ambience and service!  will definitely recommend to friends and colleagues."
2024-02-23,Cesare,5.0,server jeff -excellent- ambiance great- welcoming staff - a+
2024-02-21,Barbara,4.0,the food is really good.  our only complaint is that there was too much of it.
2024-02-20,MichaelV,4.0,"food was okay.
service was okay.
convenient location.
plenty of parking."
2024-02-20,DarleneD,5.0,"both the salmon and swordfish meals were delicious. service was excellent as well. we prefer this legal over the one in chestnut hill even though it’s a little farther away from us. much nicer ambiance and not as cramped, plus we prefer a booth. the new menu format is great too!"
2024-02-18,SteveD,4.0,my family had a great me and it was cooked to perfection. the only thing i would say that was negative it is the small selection of desserts.
2024-02-18,HenryK,2.0,"i made a reservation for 2 on open table for 7 15 and we were finally seated at 7 50.
the food was fantastic and michael was a superb server.  it was pretty clear too many walkins were seated first.  the waiting area was overcrowded and my wife had her hip replaced 2 months ago and having a reservation was very important to our having a good time - having to stand for 30 minutes wasn't a good idea."
2024-02-17,JohnE,5.0,"had a bonus coupon from the holidays that was expiring so, i decided to go for lunch. had a caesar salad which was huge, and quite good. and a bowl of clam chowder which is always good but, seemed better than i remembered. thoroughly enjoyed"
2024-02-17,KP21,4.0,"our server tom was outstanding, and the meals were delicious.  flatbread appetizer was at best ordinary. did i mention tom? the menu here has changed...not sure if that is positive or negative. the prices have jumped...a lot. $120 for lunch with no alcohol seems steep (2 entrees, 1 app). again...the food was delicious but the value??"
2024-02-17,BostonTastes,2.0,"we were seated in a booth with duct taped seats. gray duct tape. the section has multiple booths like this. legals must be on hard times if they can’t repair or replace them. the cherry stones we had were fine and the chowder too. however, we both ordered the fried fish sandwich and we both received something that tasted like nothing. it was like they ran out of fresh fish and went to the supermarket and bought two little frozen fish nuggets to put on a bun. i wonder if this location is still owned by legals because if it is they need to get somebody out here and quality check it. i’ll return to legal harborside or legals at chestnut hill but this one is a hard pass going forward. and thank god, i live equidistance to row 34 in burlington."
2024-02-17,Wade,5.0,"tony and the staff are great. we have enjoyed having jeff, matt and mike serve us.
the food is excellently prepared and is piping hot when it arrives to the table."
2024-02-17,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"everything was good. we were seated 20 minutes late, which is not good"
2024-02-16,YSKim,5.0,"as always, our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to our table efficiently.  our server judith l made our dining experience fun and memorable.  the manager came to our table to greet us in the beginning and then later dropped by to make sure our expectations were met.  they were exceeded!"
2024-02-14,jsands222,5.0,"food is consistently good. fresh and  well prepared. excellent service. 

love the bob bons for dessert. always a great. 

will return"
2024-02-14,Mike,4.0,the back room was not nice compared to restaurant
2024-02-14,Jaye,4.0,"the menu and  quality have changed greatly since original owner sold.    mypartners cioppini was very good.   my salmon was dry, vege's grilled and burned.   the cole slaw was the best thing."
2024-02-12,Jules,5.0,delicious food every time. attentive and accurate waitstaff. we'll be back!
2024-02-11,johnd,2.0,"7:00 pm reservation made days ahead. arrived and were told it would be ""a couple of minutes"" 25 minutes later we were taken to a table.....that was already occupied. finally seated 35 minutes after arriving. not good, however our waiter was excellent on every level and the food never disappoints. having said that, none of it is worth waiting 35 minutes for when there are other more efficient options. after decades of being a customer i doubt we'll go back. really poor table management and they really don't care."
2024-02-10,BrigidD,5.0,"it was a little bit of a wait for our table even with a reservation but subsequently everything went smoothly. our waiter was just super super nice and i appreciate the creative fish dishes and sides here. husband and i cleaned our plates.

one thing to note--could corporate make the up-to-date nutrition facts available? there are published nutrition facts but none of the stuff listed was on today's menu."
2024-02-10,SPC73,5.0,we had a great experience as always. shae was a wonderful server. we have also had jeff in the past. i have also eaten at the bar and the staff there is amazing!
2024-02-09,HarrietA,3.0,"food has been better. since it has been sold, not as superior quality.  too expensive for shat you get...
server was great, let us sit as long as we liked."
2024-02-06,Retiredteacher,5.0,"4 different dinners, all excellent.  service couldn’t have been better!"
2024-02-05,Julie,4.0,the staff was very welcoming and professional.   the restaurant was clean and inviting.   prices were high.   service was good.  food was okay.
2024-02-04,AnaR,3.0,"despite having a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes for the table. we saw people a little bothered by the wait and the hosts were not very friendly."
2024-02-03,MelC,4.0,"our server chae was wonderful!  happy, helpful, knowledgeable.
the lobster roll - (hot) just ok"
2024-02-03,StephanieP,5.0,"the food and drinks were delicious and service was outstanding. our server, jeff, was so friendly, helpful, and attentive."
2024-02-02,jmel,5.0,the trout dish was a big hit! the server sweetly catered  to the older guest that was with me. thank you
2024-02-01,Ballou,5.0,"jeff, our waiter, did a terrific job! his meal suggestion was spot on! seafood casserole for me! salmon for my wife! the bon-bons for dessert-perfect!"
2024-01-31,YSKim,5.0,our server judith l made our dining experience very memorable.  she exceeded our expectations-:))
2024-01-30,Kimberly,2.0,very poor quality of food especially for the cost.  no seasoning.  shells in my entree.
2024-01-29,JohnE,5.0,delicious food and excellent service. superb accommodation of food allergies.
2024-01-28,AllisonM,4.0,"the fish tacos, salmon and chicken sandwich were all very tasty.  service was competent and friendly."
2024-01-27,Wzaza,4.0,"the striker was a bit overcooked. good but not great. bring back the lemon caper dole!!!!!!!! our waiter, jeff, was fantastic."
2024-01-27,Misha,5.0,"our waiter was wonderfully pleasant, the food was great - we each got the lobster roll, tons of warm lobster, delicious - and were happy with our dining experience."
2024-01-26,CFCF,5.0,always a fan with eating at the bar.  the bartenders were attentive and friendly.
2024-01-26,MichelleP,5.0,amazing lobster roll!  our waiter quincy was great very attentive and had a wonderful demeanor.
2024-01-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always excellent food and service. the lobster roll was the biggest and most delicious that i have ever had....and i have eaten lots of lobster rolls in my lifetime!
2024-01-24,Ballou,5.0,"another great lunch with judy, our favorite server!"
2024-01-24,BobD,5.0,"judith provided excellent, attentive, friendly & timely service.
food was fresh, well prepared and spiced, nicely presented."
2024-01-24,Resident,4.0,menu had a good selection and healthy choices. lots of protein chosices to add to salads which were fresh.
2024-01-23,Simplie,5.0,"clean and well ran restaurant. outstanding, genuine customer service by quincy. we made a reservation for our next visit and requested him. the ladies that i met there for lunch said that the manager of legal's came over to the table, they had a bit of conversation and was really nice. i think that is quite awesome that the manager too the time to stop by the customer's tables. once again, quincy is a great waiter. he makes you felt welcomed and he is attentive."
2024-01-20,ChrisG,4.0,"we have dined at legal many times.  the food is always good.  the menu has changed recently and some of my favorites were not listed (the szechuan green beans and the street corn sides, for example).  on the plus side, they offered fish tacos, which were very good.  they did have options for the vegan members of the family and also gluten free options."
2024-01-19,KevinB,3.0,"the food was good, the service was excellent, but it is insanely expensive for those things l. it is much more expensive than other restaurants of a similar level, in my opinion."
2024-01-18,ChristopherW,5.0,food and service were great! excellent atmosphere for a business dinner.
2024-01-18,Tsquared,5.0,"the only negative is the booth we were sitting in, the seat was worn out and ripped.  it sort of took all of us by surprise, as the restaurant is always clean and presentable."
2024-01-16,JackS,4.0,great experience with family on a stormy night. place was empty. service was attentive. food was excellent.
2024-01-16,Lobster4Me,4.0,"two for one lobster rolls is a good deal. extra long roll filled with claw and knuckle meat/celery/scallions and very light mayo. served with tasty fries and good cole slaw.
one is $43, which is a bit pricey. overall, prices are steep, but that's legals.
a 6 oz glass of wine for $15!"
2024-01-15,BobT,3.0,not as good as in the past.  legal definitely moving downward in overall value.
2024-01-15,out2dine,5.0,"we sat at a very nice table and enjoyed a wonderful dinner. legal’s had their clam chowder promotion and we had 2 bowls of delicious clam chowder. they were out of steak and swordfish, so we picked grilled shrimp and scallops for entrees and both were excellent. the waitress was friendly and gave us excellent service. legal seafoods continues to be one of our favorite restaurants in the area."
2024-01-15,StephenK,3.0,"as a loyal customer of legal seafood in framingham i was disappointed to be seated at a table on the upper level that had torn seating which had been repaired with blue duct tape.  i also noticed a second table with the same worn upholstery.  i don't believe this is an acceptable standard for ppx hospitality.  my concern is that lack of attention to this detail will spill over into more critical functions of the restaurant's operation.  this property is in need of renovation.  for my visit, the food and service were very good."
2024-01-15,Elizabeth,5.0,best clam chowder i’ve ever had. everything was excellent.
2024-01-13,CraigB,3.0,"legals remains several notches below what it was for many years and it is a shame to see this restaurant fall so far. the menu options are very limited and largely over-priced. as is typical recently, asking for various meals or side dishes is met with a response for the waiter that people ask for that all the time but it is not on the menu. the service has gone from being truly special to average at best. we waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged. rolls that we asked multiple times did not arrive until the meals came."
2024-01-11,Ballou,5.0,"we returned to legal framingham today just two days after our last visit. about the same time-4:00 pm. as we expected, the food and service was great! judy, our server, was outstanding. all of our selections were delivered hot and tasty. my fish sandwich platter and my wife’s salmon were perfect. emily, the  manager, stopped by to see how we were enjoying our early dinner and to respond to our last review. needless to say, we were impressed with her sincerity and commitment to providing the best dining experience. legal framingham remains one of our top choices for lunch and dinner!"
2024-01-09,Ballou,3.0,"unfortunately, our meal wasn’t up to legal’s usual standards. it was probably due to the time of day-3:30 pm. the rolls served were stale and the broccoli wasn’t too hard and had to be sent back. my lobster roll was a bit tough. our server did everything right. unfortunately, the kitchen let him down. even though this experience wasn’t the best, we will return."
2024-01-01,GR8place,3.0,"we visit legal often, this time the meal was below the usual high quality. my salmon was undercooked even when i asked for it to be well done. my wife’s fish was not very warm when served but we conceded getting the staff attention on a busy night in framingham. we will try other spots but like not this one again. the server at the bar was friendly, talkative and very busy."
2024-01-01,SusanK,5.0,"a little dinner in the bar at lsf doesn’t disappoint- a crisp, cold, delicious martini, some oysters and crab cakes- perfect year end."
2024-01-01,idaP,3.0,"not interested in 20yr old flippant servers. separate checks means separate checks, not split. didnt want my friend to have to pay for mine. but she did because it was split. and he did not offer to change it right away so my friend paid more because she kindly let it go but it was clearly not what i wanted and then he made some flippant comment."
2023-12-31,BethW,5.0,"our new year’s eve dinner at legal couldn’t have been a better experience.  prompt service, comfortable atmosphere, delicious cocktails and a nice menu.  our server patrick was more than competent, efficient, and friendly-great job!!!"
2023-12-29,TamarG,3.0,"our server was an absolute star! however, the food here is always so mediocre - it's so expensive for such meh food, save your money."
2023-12-28,GTuval,5.0,"tom was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. super awesome"
2023-12-28,PamelaZ,1.0,we had a good meal that ended with seeing a mouse in the dining room. we spoke to the manager who never apologized nor did anything to compensate for our horror. what was scampering around our food at night if that’s what’s visible by day!? yuck! never going back and shame on that manager!
2023-12-27,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was attentive, courteous, and efficient.  our meal was prepared to our exact order and delivered to our table in a timely manner."
2023-12-26,JackS,3.0,"the framingham store which is usually stellar, was a little off their game tonight. 
they ran out of my usually requested liquor yet still charged me for it on the bill.
they brought over the wrong wine for a 2nd glass even though it was a refill.
oh, well, i guess we'll chalk it up to post holiday fatigue and i'm sure this usually very good team will be back on par for our next visit."
2023-12-23,TomR,5.0,seats in booths are worn and should be replaced. larger water cups.
2023-12-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"was a great visit. our first time to this location. they have a new (at least to us) menus with so many gluten free offerings, it was awesome. will be going back again now knowing that."
2023-12-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,sam was truly excellent. we enjoyed our meal very much.
2023-12-22,DavidF,5.0,terrific celebration night. a+ all around! great food great service!
2023-12-21,LynneA,5.0,"the food was delicious and served quickly. and being the holiday season, there was a festive feel to the evening"
2023-12-20,GeoffreyM,1.0,"very slow service, nice but overwhelmed waitress not supported by lousy delivery. 30 minutes to get drinks, came after appetizer, very slow desert....i ordered vanilla ice cream & espesso came 20 mins apart. ridiculous. food ordinary apart from clam chowder which continues to be only reason i still use lsf"
2023-12-17,LynS,4.0,"our waitress was amazing! she was nice, polite, and showed her comedic personality. she got our meals to the table in a timely manor and casually checked back to support our needs. thank you for giving great customer service."
2023-12-17,Bllgh,5.0,server was excellent. the striped bass special was outstanding. the vegetable selections are extensive and very good. much better than other restaurants
2023-12-16,Scooter,5.0,"so happy that it felt like the old legal's was back. after the sale the menu had changed, now they are now offering more choices that were missing. like very much that the test kitchen has a new section on the menu. still missing the asian choices of the past. my mediteranean swordfish was excellent as were the jumbo shrimp!  and the rolls are always the best!"
2023-12-14,Megan,5.0,"wonderful service, excellent food. always come here when in boston."
2023-12-13,DeborahB,5.0,"great food, a bit costly but not over the top.  portions were ample. fish was perfectly cooked (trout and halibut) and seasoned.  bread was hot and tasty. 
dessert was good. like it especially because seating is well spaced for those more compromised."
2023-12-10,StephenK,3.0,"have been a loyal legal's guest for 35 years.  very disappointed with the special halibut and sea bass entrees.  both were overcooked (dry) served with undercooked poor-quality asparagus and bland jasmine rice.  the crab meat served on top of the halibut lacked flavor.  having recently enjoyed sea bass at legal's sister restaurant, smith & wollensky, a steak house, i have to wonder why legal's cannot deliver as good, if not, superior quality fish entrees."
2023-12-10,MaryC,4.0,service was excellent -
2023-12-10,OpenTable Diner,4.0,yellow fin tuna was delicious and perfectly cooked.  i like eating there because i’m gf.
2023-12-08,sunningdale,5.0,"legal is one of the few restaurants where you know you will always get quality food and exceptional service.
our visit last night once again met those expectations"
2023-12-07,danak,4.0,the pace and seating were excellent!  it was a most enjoyable evening and i would return!
2023-12-07,Ballou,5.0,"amanda was fantastic. food and service great as always. lunch salmon and crab salad roll as usual. bon bons for desert.  nice, quiet booth. used my $10 bonus discount (app) as well. great place for an early weekday dinner."
2023-12-07,BrianT,5.0,"great food, attentive staff, clean and modern ambiance."
2023-12-01,Wzaza,3.0,nice dinner but not what we were used to at legal. missed the sole dishes as well as oysters legal. seems the menu has shrunk.
2023-11-28,Ross,5.0,waiter was very helpful and friendly. this was the best meal i have had at legal seafoods in the past 3 years. i loved the new menu.
2023-11-27,sisjps1021,5.0,the bartender was amazing. not only was he attentive in serving us a glass of wine and a cocktail but he went above and beyond. thank you again for going the distance. love the framingham location!
2023-11-27,VitoD,4.0,"rug and dining room was tired, need to updated. food was great and so was the service.."
2023-11-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,just so so. whatever happened to the original concept?
2023-11-25,ChartHouse,5.0,great food and service!  they even made a slight modification from their old menu upon request (calamari) which we really appreciated!
2023-11-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"server was excellent! kind and personable; well managed large party (11 people). no issues with her at all.

we’ve had our family thanksgiving gatherings here for years and this year food definitely not as good as in past. examples: rice pilaf cold, broccoli  burnt and undercooked; some fish dishes dry; chowder wicked salty.

host station people also very good. our reservation was at 1p on 11/24/23 in framingham."
2023-11-24,KateR,5.0,jeff made our day!  the food was fantastic and jeff's service was outstanding.
2023-11-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"absolutely amazing. the manager, alondra, greeted us and was super friendly.  our server sean was so attentive. he told us about the specials and made suggestions on which wine to select. sean made sure to check in with us during our meal and actually poured wine into our glasses each time he stopped to at the table. another manager, i believe her name was emily, checked on our experience as well and had the biggest and best smile. overall from start to finish we could not have been happier with our saturday night dinner and experience."
2023-11-18,LenL,5.0,food and waitstaff were both excellent. delivers consistently high-quality.
2023-11-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"new menu was perfect, everything was delicious and service was excellent, will be back!!"
2023-11-12,LoriL,5.0,"overall, our food was very good but didn't come out "" hot""....my husband had a clam chowder which was warm.....i had the tuna from ltk. flavors were great but the brocolli had a little too much soy for my liking. calamari was perfectly cooked and delish."
2023-11-12,Ballou,5.0,"judy, our server was fantastic! i had the crab roll, whipped sweet potatoes and coleslaw. the pumpkin cheese cake dessert was phenomenal. my partner had grilled salmon, whipped sweet potatoes, and steamed broccoli. comfortable booth in a quiet area. always a great time at legal framingham!"
2023-11-10,OpenTable Diner,3.0,6:30 appointment and we were seated right on time. not sure if our waitress was new or just having a bad night. took forever to take our drink orders and even longer to get them. food was great per usual once we finally ordered. the food definitely saved the night because although the waitress was very nice she took forever to get everything.
2023-11-08,KimmB,5.0,"first time in framingham in a long time.  great service, great food, not crowded, not noisy, wonderful booths.  my only complaint is that they should have a lunch menu with smaller portions and prices."
2023-11-04,Greg,3.0,"kind of a disappointing meal. we’ve dined here many times. as much a frustrating meal as anything. we asked for feta instead of blue cheese on a salad with filet. it came with blue cheese. means the person with the salad doesn’t start eating until 10 minutes after everyone else. asked for plain, steamed broccoli. it came covered in butter sauce. now child is eating chicken with no vegetable for 10 minutes. asked for no butter sauce on fish. that was done, but the asparagus it came with was smothered in butter sauce so the fish was sitting in butter sauce.  the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like salt. so not good. ended up being a disappointing meal all around. when you pay as much as you do at legal seafood, you expect these things to be correct. and you expect your food to be prepared properly. when that isn’t done, you’re tossing a lot of money at a bad meal."
2023-11-04,Marci,5.0,great lunch menu. lots of variety. not just fish and seafood. old favorites and great new additions. we'll be back!
2023-11-03,MauraF,5.0,"the staff was so friendly, patient and helpful with our large party and did not rush us.  the food was very good, but our server went above and beyond.  many thanks!!!"
2023-11-03,JeanS,5.0,great food and service . yay legal  seafood you rock!
2023-11-02,Aaron,1.0,"the last time we came, i almost didn't come back because the service was so poor, but the food was great, so we gave it another shot. this time, the service was worse and the food was bad, too. i have a soft spot for legal sea foods because i used to eat at the copley mall location very often, but it's a different place now.

i'll say it again: i realize how hard it is to find good servers, but when your dinner for two with no alcohol is $120, you expect a little bit more than the slow, inattentive, tone-deaf service we received last night.

our server didn't even notice us for 15 minutes after we were seated, rushed us through our orders and seemed in too much of a hurry to let me finish a sentence, delivered the wrong fish (grilled, not blackened), and their ""fix"" for this was to just rub the blackening seasoning on my already-cut fish and hand it back to me.

she took 10 minutes to deliver simple seltzer waters, messed up my friend's meal and had to re-cook it (why not mine?), and then was tone-deaf enough to ask us if we were thinking about dessert when she hadn't even brought the seltzers we asked for yet.

legal sea foods framingham is circling the drain. the kids who work there need to be sent out to have dinner at a really nice place so they can see what real service is supposed to look like, because they have absolutely no clue. we'll just go to burton's next door from now on, at least they know how to operate a restaurant."
2023-10-31,JackS,5.0,"legal seafoods is a favorite but the quality of food, service and ambience varies widely from location to location. my wife and i have been faithful patrons of lsf for over 40 years and have witnessed many ups and downs throughout both the berkowitz and ppx years. we live south of boston but make our way to the framingham store as its food and service are head and shoulders above most other locations. the gm and team are obviously doing something right."
2023-10-28,SrMedDir,4.0,grilled octopus was very good. rainbow trout had no bones and was delicious. salmon was expertly prepared. wait staff were very attentive and excellent overall.
2023-10-28,KahunaMystic,5.0,"i don't recall our server's name but she was very nice. she could have been a bit more attentive in that i had to wait quite a while to ask her for a water refill but, for the most part, she was friendly and professional."
2023-10-27,Martha,4.0,excellent food!  service was slow but we weren’t in a hurry.
2023-10-27,YSKim,5.0,"our server andy was attentive, courteous, and efficient.  food was prepared to our exact order, delivered to our table timely, and tasty."
2023-10-25,JosieY,5.0,wonderful experience celebrating a birthday.  will be back.
2023-10-23,CarolK,5.0,"food was excellent as always, the service was great. would definitely go back."
2023-10-22,NathanS,5.0,staff was friendly and food was fantastic! the lobster roll was amazing.
2023-10-22,PeggyR,5.0,the same great legal's menu served at this metro west location. easy to find off the mass pike on route 9 with ample parking
2023-10-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,had a great experience. new menu items were great ! will definitely come back to try again.
2023-10-18,ChrisM,5.0,"as always....excellent.  in fact one of the guests with me, at there 2 nights in a row!"
2023-10-18,Foodguy,3.0,"the service was attentive and polite, but unfortunately the food has gone downhill in recent years. the famed chowder was just ok, and the baked haddock was fishy and overcooked. overpriced for what it is. there are better alternatives."
2023-10-17,WadeP,5.0,clam chowder is a must. seafood casserole was fantastic! service was appropriately attentive.
2023-10-14,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"had a reservation at 6, got there early. hostess gave our table that we request two people who didn’t even have a reservation, hostess claimed that they needed to get through reservations of 5:30 and 5:45 first, no one was there for those reservations. was forgotten about after we order our meal for almost an hour. nice waitress did comp most of our meal. rude hostess though."
2023-10-13,LindaB,5.0,we grew up in massachusetts and now live on the west coast. we treated ourselves to baked stuffed lobster (smaller size) and it was everything we hoped for sean was a great server. it was a little loud in there but otherwise everything was perfect.
2023-10-13,Scott,3.0,tiny portion size for the tuna...hardly even appetizer size
2023-10-09,Aaron,3.0,"legal sea foods has always been a solid option, and one that i choose when i just want reliably good food and a nice dining experience. the food at legal remains fabulous. i had a yellowfin tuna steak and it was delicious and cooked perfectly.

service at our framingham legal, though, has been a bit up and down. i realize that restaurants aren't having the easiest time finding help, but when you're charging $50 a plate (and i feel the price is worth it for the food), it's rough to be seated and served by young kids who don't know what they're doing.

we were given lunch menus instead of dinner menus (almost didn't notice), our server forgot 1/3 of the order until it was too late to fix it, and was slow to bring even very simple water refills.

that isn't the kind of experience you expect when you're going to pay about $100 for two people for a basic dinner (we weren't even drinking alcohol).

i'll still return to legal, i still think the food is great, but i hope they lean into staff training a bit more."
2023-10-09,CharleneM,5.0,"chowder is hard to beat. excellent lobster roll and great key lime pie. we met with old friends
and  our waiter didn’t rush us at all."
2023-10-08,lefty,4.0,only real downside: no southern comfort or tia maria. vodka tonic was the worst i ever had.
2023-10-07,Pohlin,3.0,ordered the seafood platter.  scallops were way over cooked.  took a while for the check to come.  requested a change in table as we were next to a loud party.
2023-10-04,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"they brought wrong food
server was very busy so service wasn’t up to usual standards
but still love legal’s!"
2023-10-03,OleAnder,4.0,the wellfleet oysters and yellow fin tuna (seared only) were excellent!
2023-10-01,out2dine,4.0,"our reservation was for 4 people and they were able to quickly change it when 1 more person showed up. legals clam chowder is delicious and always a must order item. all of our entrees were fresh and very delicious. mediterranean swordfish was a generous portion and very good. cioppino was loaded with seafood and excellent.

my only complaint is the waitress was not very friendly and didn’t want to spend any extra time with us. she was very abrupt and gone by the time we had a question to ask. it seemed hard to communicate with her and i felt like we were bothering her if we asked a question."
2023-10-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the food, service & ambience were top notch!  can't wait to get back!"
2023-09-25,KATV,4.0,"we enjoyed the lobster day special! a ""mini"" lobster roll that was a good size along with very good lobster bisque, cole slaw and fries.  we all wished that this was a regular on the menu."
2023-09-23,maryk,5.0,"great meal shared with family members, service was very good, personally appreciated gluten free fried clams; salads, lobster ravioli, fish and chips and mexican cod all enjoyed by all.  only criticism was noise level - difficult to hear waiter, conversation through out dinner above music ( may have been seated too close to a speaker.) - but look forward to eating there again."
2023-09-21,REDSOX,3.0,"service was great. food was tasty and well presented, but portion size has shrunk considerably. ( 5 scallops for $28.) lunch at legal is no longer an enticing option."
2023-09-17,GregL,4.0,legal seafood is known for the quality and freshness of its food. we were not disappointed.
2023-09-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great food, but smaller portions than i remember. attentive servers make up for small meal size."
2023-09-15,DaveyB,5.0,"see jeff!  by far the best waiter i’ve ever dealt with. both my girlfriend and i have allergies and he took them very serious. we had some laughs had good conversations and he was extremely good and respectful and responsive with the menu questions we had, been here before and definitely will be back. maine lobster stuffed was on point!"
2023-09-15,SyedN,5.0,delicious food and excellent service. legal sea food never disappoints.
2023-09-15,JudyN,2.0,this is not the legal seafood that we remember from the past. the food was only fair (my shrimp was over cooked).  the service was poor.  our waitress took our drink orders then disappeared. we were told ten minutes later that we would now have a different waitress because the first one had too many tables.  my dinner arrived ten minutes after everyone else’s because it was given to the wrong customer.
2023-09-15,PennyC,5.0,"legal has never disappointed.  food is always fresh, service friendly."
2023-09-15,MichaelG,3.0,been a loyal patron to legals for 40 years. framingham was always a great choice. waiter didn't come back for 30 minutes after we got our food. baked schrod was a little overdone.
2023-09-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"very good
cfdwsfghjjgffddvhkkopiiggfddsddxbbgfdsss"
2023-09-09,JackS,3.0,"entree' salad arrived incorrect twice. management comp'd the salad but the ambience of the meal with my wife was broken. poor dining experience at this usually stellar location. 
experience at the bar upon arrival was excellent. we should have remained there for dinner.
i guess we all have a bad day now and then. 
will be back"
2023-09-08,Allan,5.0,"jeffrey our waiter told us about a special seafood caserole that was featured.  we tried it and were blown away.  was outstanding in every aspect.  besides the special
jeffrey was an outstanding waiter.  because of his attitude, we cam back the next night."
2023-09-07,KirstenS,3.0,"we have been here many times before and we’re very disappointed with the food. the rolls were not properly baked, my tuna was overcooked, and the boston crème pie was dry."
2023-09-04,RonB,4.0,"new streamlined menu offers a good variety of seafood and seafood alternatives.
prices are in line with the generally higher market costs of seafood.
quality is excellent. portions are average in size. 
our go to restaurant for all things seafood!"
2023-09-03,Tonydinesout,3.0,service was a step or two slower than usual. mostly the kitchen. server was nice and attentive. portions seem smaller than before and prices higher....food generally tasted like it usually does which is quite good. sushi on the menu is a bit of a miss.
2023-09-03,JanetD,4.0,"fried clam plate was excellent.
simply grilled swordfish was very good.
broccoli and rice pilaf were not hot enough but waitress immediately brought new ones.
rolls were tough...they used to be much better.
waitress was excellent.
wine and beer were overpriced."
2023-09-02,MarkL,5.0,"reservation made and we were seated in timely fashion. some of our group arrived late but the server took care of the group that was on time.
server explained menu items and correctly to all orders. food was delivered in timely fashion and was excellent.
we enjoyed our experience and it was exactly as good as we had hoped"
2023-09-01,BernardoB,5.0,"best bread in the business!  those rolls are decadent!  oyster selection and the octopus salad were superb.  i had a big, vulgar lobster and it was exceptionally prepared and served with the right sides. my daughter had the shrimp scampi and she loved it.  bread pudding was a fitting crowning to this glorious experience.  in addition. alexis, our server, excelled at her professionalism and attention to make this an unforgettable experience."
2023-08-31,Mary,5.0,"beginning with the assistant manager who greeted us, and seeing two of our party may need seating beyond a booth, she arranged a more suitable space. 
our waiter was gracious and light-hearted. the food was excellent. 
our group had a great visit amid great food and circuses."
2023-08-26,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always a great meal and experience at legals! great service from drinks through dessert.
2023-08-25,Mike,5.0,"been to legal many times and my wife and i are never disappointed.  the service is good, wait staff attentive, and the food is always good."
2023-08-24,Lisa,3.0,we were a party of 3 & the server confused our order. he brought 2 correct dishes to the table & 1 that was not what we had ordered.  it took quite a bit of time to get the dish corrected & the server was confused & took all 3 away.  we didn't know if the other 2 were correct because he didn't ask & we didn't see the dishes & couldn't identify that the other 2 were correct.  (i.e. he started the order delivery saying fish & chips ^ then we said no one had ordered fish & chips & he took all away but i guess the other two were in fact right.)  they did make it up by bringing a free drink which was nice but it took a while to get  the corrected dish & by the time it arrived the other two of us had finished eating.  a bit disappointing-- especially as it was my birthday!  but the food was good!
2023-08-24,LindaO,5.0,everything was awesome!!  food was delicious- generous portions-  and our server was excellent!
2023-08-24,RichC,5.0,food was the usual excellent.  our waiter was extremely nice and respectful of us.  clam chowder outstanding; fish sandwich outstanding.  all employees were extremely pleasant and courteous.  thanks.
2023-08-23,mdpngrammie,3.0,our fried clams were overcooked. the belly part tasted like the strip because of frying them too long. the waitress never came back to check on the food.
2023-08-22,Victoria,1.0,"this was a disappointing visit, i've never been to a legal's with such underwhelming service and quality.

the host was a trainee and did not know how to greet us or locate our reservation. there was no trainer with him when we arrived, but eventually, a trainer came to the host stand and found the reservation.

it was a celebration, so we ordered two of their largest-sized lobsters, excited to have a treat. when they arrived, they were undercooked (the meat was soggy and the eggs inside one of the lobsters were still black and slimy, rather than turning bright red and round as they do when cooked), and the lobsters were not cleaned properly (there was green goop all over the lobster tails). 

when i ordered, the waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu, and instead of telling me he would find out the answer, he just gave me the incorrect answer. for example, i asked what was in the side dish of ""pearl couscous salad."" he told me that it was round pasta. i replied that i know what pearl couscous is, i'm just wondering what veggies are included in the ""salad."" he said there were no veggies, it was just plain couscous. i ordered it as a side dish, and of course, it had lots of different veggies in it because it was, after all, a salad. 

just to top it off, we had to flag down the waiter to request the rolls (this is my daughter's favorite part of a visit to legal's, so it was disappointing that they didn't bring rolls right away).

i usually think legal's is a great restaurant, but i'm not going back to legal's in framingham."
2023-08-18,Christine,3.0,"the rice was raw. like chewing hard rice that's not cooked. when mentioning to the waitstaff, the brought another bowl of raw crunchy rice. the baked stuffed lobster was filled with just stuffing and one piecenof shrimp. paid 112 dollars plus tip. not worth the trip."
2023-08-16,MaryR,5.0,"as usual, the food was very good and the service very attentive.  the manager even stopped by our table to see how our lunch was going."
2023-08-13,out2dine,4.0,"we enjoyed a delicious dinner. our reservation got us right in to a table. the server was great. the new england clam chowder is always a must and worth having. fried calamari appetizer was very good. all of our entrees were very good-red dragon sushi, mediterranean swordfish and yellow fin tuna."
2023-08-13,Nonicamandmartin,5.0,"excellent food, competitive pricing for a good seafood restaurant with an established reputation.  service was excellent and for a sunday afternoon in the summer there was plenty of seating with no wait."
2023-08-11,Waylandmom,5.0,always good.  consistent.  manager always comes out to check on us.  love it!  i brought a friend who is visiting from overseas and she was impressed with the lobster roll!
2023-08-10,JayS,5.0,consistently good food and service. menu is varied and always changing. easy to get to location with plenty of parking right by the restaurant.
2023-08-10,jeffs,5.0,"excellent service, great food.   great anniversary desser."
2023-08-08,DavidC,5.0,"i loved the rainbow trout!  what a treat!  new england seafood lovers may not appreciate fresh water fish.  i first had fresh rainbow trout in michigan over 50 years ago.  (obviously it is best if you catch it yourself with a fly that you made yourself and then cooked on a campfire, but we can't always do that.  we are not all hemingways.)   to eat a rainbow trout you have to put it in your mouth, chew it briefly to release the flavor, then let it sit on your tongue while you inhale the aromas it releases.  no other fish comes close to that epiphany."
2023-08-08,Ballou,5.0,"scott, our server , was excellent. after a rocky start due to some confusion at the check in desk, scott quickly made amends by treating us extremely well. our food was prepared as we like it and it was served hot and fast. if you visit legal in framingham ma, ask for scott! you won’t be disappointed!"
2023-08-06,Jessica,3.0,"really gone downhill over the years. this meal was decidedly mediocre, with some terrible crab cakes and some eh chowder."
2023-08-05,seand,5.0,"legal seafoods never fails to satisfy for a special night out & a fantastic dinner. my wife & i went for our anniversary and had a wonderful meal, a great host and memorable time! a++++"
2023-08-05,TrishC,5.0,we were a party of 7 -the server was terrific-food was excellent
2023-08-05,DIANEB,5.0,very costly for 4 shrimp on a salad with iced tea and lemonade. had one coffee bon bon and with tip 77.00 for lunch.
2023-07-30,ChristinaF,3.0,the waitress was great but the food was not fresh and that was disappointing. i was hoping for better quality from legal seafood.
2023-07-28,ReneeM,3.0,"the fish was fresh, but very bland. nothing seemed thoughtfully prepared. table of 6 and no one raved about delicious food. i had the scallops-- a little crisping and some light seasoning would have gone a long way. 
the service was excellent."
2023-07-26,SolSearcher,3.0,"the salmon entree was excellent.  the red dragon sushi roll was inedible.  the rice was improperly prepared.  sushi is challenging to get right. anyone can slice fresh fish and cucumbers.  however, cooking and preparing sushi rice correctly is the challenge.  the rice had way too much water. it was pasty, almost like pudding.  i would not order it again.  i couldn't eat it."
2023-07-23,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we have been going to legal sea foods for years if not decades, various locations. this particular location, not sure if their cook changed, it’s not the same anymore. it’s definitely more expensive as well. they messed up my order twice. i guess third time was a charm!"
2023-07-23,AnthonyC,3.0,mussels were small. we had them before and mussels were plup amd full
2023-07-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great spot in boston!  highly recommend for real seafood lovers.
2023-07-22,,3.0,dinner was fair. service was a bit over kill. caesar salad was not dressed with caesar dressing. salmon was small and very average
2023-07-22,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the service was fantastic, very friendly and accommodating. the clam chowder and lobster bisque were very good. unfortunately, everything else left much to be desired, especially at that price point.  the caesar salad wasn’t very fresh, the salmon, steak and lobster were slightly overdone; even the lobster ravioli was overcooked and the fra diavolo sauce was bland. i’m sure if i had said something, our waitress would have been more than happy to try to make it right, but being that it wasn’t just one dish, i didn’t have faith that it would be any better in the second go or with other alternatives.  again, the staff is wonderful, but not likely to return until they tighten up food quality and/or kitchen skills."
2023-07-21,TomC,4.0,"alondra? not sure if that's her name. she's a manager i think. in the midst of a flash flood tonight, she waded out to our car that was sitting in the back of the lot amidst at least 6-8 inches of water and drove it out for us. talk about above and beyond!  and this was a special night for my wife and i to try and relax as we're currently homeless because our house was recently flooded so we're already traumatized by water! thank you alondra!"
2023-07-21,travelinggal,5.0,the bar makes outstanding cocktails.  our meals were very fresh and well prepared.  i noted a few people ordered lobster rolls which were the biggest i've ever seen (i had the scallops.)  legals in framingham is reliably good and very convenient.
2023-07-21,KathleenL,4.0,"great food, a bit noisy, service was friendly but slow."
2023-07-20,WabanJane,4.0,i have returned to legal's framingham several times since the new iteration of the company.  the menu is a little different but they are doing a great job and i have had good food and experiences over the past months.
2023-07-17,Arlene,5.0,the food was excellent.  the waiter was perfect.  would have preferred eating in the dining room rather than the bar but we didn't want to wait.
2023-07-14,JohnE,5.0,"excellent food and service..per usual. accommodated food allergies appropriately and the server was excellent, checking with the chef for those in our party who had allergies."
2023-07-08,LindaZ,5.0,"we were very pleased to be seated in a nice area of the restaurant, at a moderate to quiet noise level, with excellent service, not only on the part of the waitress, but all receptionists and a woman who was training for new restaurant to open in virginia here in greater boston for training. she was a pleasure to talk to and will be an asset to the new location.
we both ordered a ""test kitchen"" entree, and they were absolutely delightful in both taste and presentation. we had a nice evening."
2023-07-08,Tiluka,5.0,many visits over many years and have never been disappointed. should be the go-to spot for seafood for both residents and visitors. the menu is excellent!
2023-07-08,sibud,2.0,"not the same service or food that you usually get from legal !!!
my wife’s lobster was over cooked leaving it tough and some what tasteless.
my sea scallops came out cold and the second attempt wasn’t much better !!!
the table in front of us arrived like 20 minutes after us and they got their drinks before we got ours which were ordered 15 minutes before the other table was seated !!!
will we go back maybe but not in near future and my just try another location to see if the service and food is any different then framingham’s !!!
😢 😢😢"
2023-07-08,DonnieS,5.0,"legal seafood never disappoints. the food is always well prepared. service is always on point. the staff, overall, is very attentive and anticipates your needs.

the only point that i'd like to bring up is the wine list. we miss the old wine lists created by sandy block. the selection, pours and pricing have changed greatly since his passing, and could use more attention. it was one of legal's highlights."
2023-07-07,Bllgh,5.0,the food was fresh and very well prepared. greek salad was delicious as were the vegetables.  this seafood is the tops
2023-07-04,SuzytheGardener,4.0,"legal is pretty reliable, but because of the weather i think it was busier than usual. can't cook out when it is raining. they were out of whole lobsters, and that is the reason we went there! tradition has it that my husband always gets a boiled lobster on his july 4th birthday.

daughter had fish and chips which were good as she has to avoid gluten. note to cooks, don't put the fried fish on top of the fries, it makes them soggy. glad you have gluten free offerings."
2023-07-04,StatLady,5.0,"outstanding dinner and waiter. he was knowledgeable, professional, and friendly to talk with throughout drinks, dinner, and dessert with espresso."
2023-07-04,Hopmom,2.0,"july 4th at legal framingham was very busy! iwe have 3 generations of legal fans in our family - it's a go-to for us. this was a big disappointment.

it took too long for our drinks to come out - server stopped by a number of times to apologize for the delay.

my boyfriend ordered a standby baked fish with rice and broccoli - it was good, just what he expected.

i first ordered the mexican street cod - a ltk menu item that i've had and like. at 6 pm they were out of cod. i ordered the beet salmon - also on the ltk menu. the plating was weird - a slather of beet puree on the salmon didn't look appetizing. it tasted ok.

the panzanella side - traditionally tomatoes, onions and crutons - was strange. it had peas, cucumbers, radishes, just 1-1/2 cherry tomatoes and lots of red onion. the combination didn't work for me. a person at a nearby table didn't eat her side salad either.

surprising disappointment as a ltk item - my vote is not to keep it on the menu.

hopefully this was a holidy hic-cup. we'll keep going to legal - esp harborside. just maybe be a little more cautious about what we order."
2023-07-04,JillS,1.0,order was not done correctly and when asked to fix it they said they were too busy
2023-07-04,Renee,4.0,"the seafood casserole is way overpriced. promises of lobster, shrimp, scallops and fish.
more like fish, 2 scallops, itsy bitsy shrimp and a few very small pieces of lobster. it seems they could provide more for $42 per casserole.

2023-07-01,sueh,5.0,"had chower, bisque, shrimp cocktail and bang bang califlower.  everything was super yummy!  waiter was fantastic!  forget his name but i'll call him ""eyelashes""!"
2023-06-29,RobertB,5.0,excellent service. the food was prepared to perfection.
2023-06-28,DavidB,5.0,we had great service all night! the food was great as well. noise level was bit high.
2023-06-27,CarolS,5.0,this is a go to place for a good seafood meal.  my cod was delicious and my sister had the boiled lobster and she loved it.
2023-06-27,Ballou,5.0,great meal and service. our server was outstanding (did not get her name). crab salad roll for me- salmon for my wife. used my legal app discount of $10!
2023-06-26,firecracker,4.0,"wedge salad was very fresh as well as a delicious dressing.  the smoked salmon was very good too, although i thought a little skimpy portion for the price.  it was a quiet afternoon and enjoyed ourselves. nice atmosphere in the bar area."
2023-06-25,Merry,5.0,food was excellent and server was attentive and very pleasant.
2023-06-24,Localdiner,5.0,food was excellent- prepared quickly and efficient polite service.
2023-06-24,CarolL,2.0,food was poor quality.  clam chowder was watery. shrimp were rubbery. pasta was stuck together. not going back.  sad to see the decline of an old favorite.
2023-06-23,WasteOfMoney,2.0,"service was chaotic. a glass of wine took way too long. 

my dinner was good but wife asked for wood grilled shrimp and got 6 small boiled shrimp with a mess of white rice. horrible presentation and no attention to quality food. yuk!

the value is very poor and management is nothing like it used to be before the sale. stay away! friday at 6:30 pm and there were many open tables. should have known."
2023-06-23,JaimeM,5.0,"our server, jeff was the best waiter we have ever had.
very attentive to all of our needs
we will ask for jeff every time we go"
2023-06-21,DBDiner,5.0,"i have dined at this legal sea food location a few times and it far surpasses the other locations (i.e. chestnut hill that i used to frequent) the food is always excellent here and the staff is so attentive and accommodating. the manager even came over to inquire about the quality of our dining experience.  most importantly the food and service surpasses most of the other locations. so if you have a choice when picking a location, i would highly recommend the framingham location!!!"
2023-06-18,PatP,5.0,father day
2023-06-18,Father,5.0,"a family favorite. we eat here every time we have a family reunion. i requested a big table in a side room, but we were in the main dining room. we got there at 11:30, though, so it wasn’t too loud. we have some hearing impaired family members. all in all, another great meal."
2023-06-12,PhilA,3.0,"just a so-so experience.
the server seemed distracted frequently forgot requests."
2023-06-12,PeterK,5.0,great place for a lunch meeting. private quiet and accommodating servers
2023-06-10,Thenormalone,5.0,"my family goes there once a year for our annual dinner. the staff always handles our group with aplomb, from the extras showing up unannounced who did not rsvp for the reservation count, to the staccato orders of the group patriarch, to the drunken, troublesome family member who's not receptive to being shut off with drinks, to  the messes, confusion etc., the staff goes above and beyond for us. the food is always incredible and served smoothly with good timing and presentation, and i'm always grateful for the sympathetic ears of the employees who lend a sympathetic ear to me when i escape the table for a little breather."
2023-06-03,Arif,5.0,"i really appreciate the reservation team for all help to get the table earlier.
the waiter provided a very good and fast service.
thanks to everybody"
2023-06-03,kathleenm,5.0,"my husband & i took our son out for his college graduation following a red sox game.  we made a reservation, which was honored when we arrived.  we were immediately taken to our table.   we ordered drinks and appetizers, which did not take too long to arrive.  the entrees were shrimp scampi, scallops, and swordfish, all of which were yummy.  the service was excellent.  waitress was very attentive and polite.  i would highly recommend this restaurant!  can't wait to go back."
2023-06-02,OpenTable Diner,3.0,my date had the mexican cod. said it was too dry. my blackened swordfish was very good. service was very good.
2023-06-02,NancyJ,3.0,i was disappointed with my fried clams. they were stringy and overcooked with virtually no bellies. everyone else had good dinners.
2023-06-01,Indianjoey,4.0,had the fish tacos and they were very bland - so i didn't eat them both.  they were served with rice and beans which were also bland;
2023-05-29,DavidW,2.0,hot lobster roll was bland.  not great and not a good value.
2023-05-28,JimD,5.0,"our server, lexi,was personable, knowledgeable, and helpful. the food was great and lived up to the reputation of the restaurant we really enjoyed the whole experience and will be back"
2023-05-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"our lunch experience was rocky at the start.  though i had explicitly requested seating in a booth at the back near the restrooms (open table), we had to press the surly staff (greeters) to be seated there. note we were dining at 11:30 am and there were only a few other people in the restaurant.  the location had a deep meaning for us and for this particular visit (in honor of our recently deceased mom with whom we have dined many times in the past in that booth).  fortunately we had a terrific waiter, mike.  his welcoming, gracious, solicitous attention made the rest of our visit delightful.  we enjoyed the crabcake seafood combo from the dinner menu.  don’t be afraid to ask for the dinner menu. well worth the price, this very filling dish includes scallops, large shrimp, a large crabcake and a light salad.  the seafood was fresh, judiciously seasoned and well cooked."
2023-05-25,Spring14,5.0,our meals were excellent. the service was exceptional. the staff took great care to accommodate my serious allergies. everything was delightful. our complements to the chef who pan seared our scallops due to possible cross-contamination on the grill to avoid allergy. they were just delicious! thank you!
2023-05-25,GaryS,5.0,"great food, great staff, one of my favorite restaurants and often take clients."
2023-05-25,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith made our dining experience very enjoyable and memorable.  she was very attentive, courteous, and efficient."
2023-05-24,Ballou,5.0,returned two days after last review. same comments except jennifer was our server. she was excellent!
2023-05-22,Ballou,5.0,"our server,kate, did an excellent job of caring for us. i had my favorite, crab roll with sweet potato mash and cole slaw. my wife had grilled salmon, jasmine rice and coleslaw. everything was prepared just as we like it. the food was served “piping” hot. great experience plus a discount thanks to the legal app!"
2023-05-20,FemR,4.0,the legal sea food restaurant has been one of the restaurants of choice anytime we plan to dine outside. the experience yesterday was good and similar to previous occasions except for the taste of the grilled trout fish which was off. the server was informed about the poor quality of the fish and was asked to inform the chef but neither the chef nor the managers attended to our complaint.
2023-05-20,sebago,5.0,"both food & service were excellent. i had stuffed lobster tails, my wife the salmon. large portions and tasty."
2023-05-20,MichaelB,3.0,"service from waiter was excellent however he did not actually serve drinks or anything else other than desert (request for stuffed or extra olives completely omitted from martini) the bar waitress actually served a martini with zero garnish - no olives, nothing!  had to ask her to go get olives.  rolls served without butter.  shame on me for ordering a filet steak at a seafood restaurant as the medium/medium rare steak was very over done past well done.   waiter offered to have them cook another but since the kitchen was clearly overwhelmed and my dinner companions were all eating, i chose not to chance another extended wait for my meal.  he did comp a desert to make up for the steak but frankly a $50 steak was ruined.  not happy with the quality of legal, certainly not what i remember or what i expect from what was and should be a high end restaurant."
2023-05-20,AlanaH,5.0,staff were friendly and helpful. food was delicious and came out quickly.
2023-05-19,jonathang,5.0,"there is one reason we go here every few weeks: serge. he makes a great cocktail called the jonny spoonz. katy knows how to make this as well.  of course the food is delicious but we go there for the cocktails.  had the anna’s special, the always consistent house salad and the usual sampling of oysters. this week they had mystics which melted on the pallet. a bit larger and not briny. at any rate, ask serge or katy for a jonny spoonz and this will become your new go to. ."
2023-05-19,2fatcats,3.0,"good service all around. friendly, attentive, efficient.
ambience: very loud
food just okay. haven’t been to a lsf in many years. not as good as i remembered."
2023-05-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"our server jeff was great! we’ve been coming to lsf forever. the food is fine, not what it used to be, but what is these days? still better than most fare out there. the service made it stellar. going out to eat is usually a disappointing experience. usually we’re waiting forever for the food, staring at empty water glasses, wondering when they’ll be refilled, and looking around in vain for our server. not with jeff! best server ever!! left nothing to be desired! will be requesting this gentleman on all future visits if he’s available."
2023-05-18,Wzaza,2.0,we have loved legal over the years. oysters legal and the sole dish were are constant go to. no more. sad. meal as a whole was overpriced for the food. crab cake was ok. nothing spectacular. there is work to be done at legal!!
2023-05-16,JonB,5.0,"we time shifted mother’s day by a couple days and visited my wife’s favorite legal on a tuesday with our daughter. it was still almost full. fortunately, we had our open table reservation.
took us right in and gave us a booth. immediate service for drinks. while i miss the old corazon aneho tequila, the casa migos they poured is very good. as was the calamari we had for an app -  crispy right out of the fryer.
my wife had a warm lobster roll and loved it- rich and tasty with the sweet buttery roll. i had the mexican street cod - perfectly cooked with lots of cheesy corn and tortilla strips. our daughter had swordfish, also with the street corn and loved it.
no room for dessert, but it was a festive night out!"
2023-05-14,susang,2.0,it was mother's day sent soup back not tasty salad was drenched in dressing prices crazy 3 people and only one glass of wine not in any hurry to go back!
2023-05-14,KimK,5.0,"my lobster was outstanding. overall handling of my severe allergy was great, with the exception of the bread which came out too quick for me to ask if it was safe so wasn’t able to eat any, just in case. but dinner was separately prepared and delivered and i felt very safe. for dessert, the one i wanted was not safe, but so long as i was told this isn’t a problem. it was delicious and no reactions, perfect meal."
2023-05-14,PamelaS,5.0,great food. one of my mom’s favorite places to eat.
2023-05-14,HeidiS,5.0,from the stuffie appie to the key lime pie dessert food and service was spot on ! great spot ...
2023-05-13,SaraC,2.0,"the food was very average for the inflated prices. most entrees are $40+, which is absurd.  a ""bowl"" of clam chowder is now the size of a cup. the restaurant itself hasn't been updated in ages, which makes it feel even more outrageous that they can charge those prices.  i would expect this from a high end restaurant... very disappointed."
2023-05-13,TreWaltham,5.0,every location i have been to is always consistent. the food is great! the service was great! wonderful 50th birthday dinner for my husband.
2023-05-13,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"food is over priced for the quality and quantity delivered. ordered oysters and they were terrible at $3.50 per. better oyster’s at whole foods for $1 on friday. ordered the seafood casserole special, $42 - got a very small dish with 2 scallops, 2 shrimp and one small lobster claw. should have ordered the cioppino. waiter talked a good story but couldn’t deliver on his “marketing “ pitch. forgot to put on the oyster appetizer and we waited 45 minutes when they delivered the main dishes. sent them back and waited another 15 minutes for the oysters. not going back there again. we ate there often in the past but this time it was a disaster."
2023-05-13,SusanT,5.0,missed the history of the restaurant at the table but the food was great.
2023-05-12,OpenTable Diner,4.0,i would have given it an excellent rating but you got rid of the chocolate cake for a pudding cake.
2023-05-08,ChrisG,5.0,"although the prices are high, i still feel the experience is worth it.  i'm sorry, i didn't get our server's name, because she was excellent, seeing to our needs without being intrusive.  she was personable and attentive, but not overbearing.  no ""perfect"" when we ordered (a personal gripe of mine is hearing a server proclaim everyone's choice as perfect)."
2023-05-07,OpenTable Diner,2.0,no where near the quality of the restaurant 's former  owner
2023-05-06,RasP,4.0,"our visit to the natick location was much better than our visit to the burlington location. the portions we as they should be, the staff was peasant, and the restaurant  dining experience was pleasant. unlike the burlington location. i was happy to receive the portion size of my appropriate for the what is being charged. burlington’s portions were incredibly small and not worth the price they charged for the meals."
2023-05-06,SandyT,5.0,the food was outstanding and the service excellent. we were seated right next to the waiter station which was a busy and a bit distracting.
2023-05-05,MarkC,4.0,"the absolute best place for seafood. 
great menu selection."
2023-05-04,Ballou,5.0,mike was an excellent waiter. he gave us great service. our food was delivered hot and tasty. my wife had grilled salmon with steamed broccoli and jasmine rice. i had the crab roll with the same sides. mike made sure our broccoli was soft and tender! we will be back! ps the hostess was very friendly and helpful!
2023-05-01,TripAdvisor,5.0,"excellent chow and service.  loved my stuffed twin lobster tails, broccoli gratin, spicy green beans.  

very highly recommended"
2023-04-29,Aaron,4.0,"legal sea foods is a boston staple, and i've eaten at various locations for years. it seems that legal has gone through some ups and downs over time, but in my estimation they're back to the experience that i expect from them, especially for the price.

the food is always fresh (""if it isn't fresh, it isn't legal"" as the motto says), made to order, and delicious. i have some personal qualms with recipe changes here and there but it isn't fair to hold my preferences against them.

on this visit, i had the blackened tuna steak and it was superb. perfectly cooked to order (medium rare), fresh, and delicious. my wife had the baked haddock and she said it was very good.

i knocked off a couple of stars for ""value"" only because this cut of fish is $40 by itself, which is justifiable for the boston area, but it ain't a ""value."" still, you know what you're getting, service was friendly and fast, and they even have things on their kids' menu that my son will eat, so i can't complain."
2023-04-29,ericw,5.0,always excellent food and service. love going to this place
2023-04-29,Goawaysoon,4.0,excellent service. maybe an off- night...salmon burned at one end and overcooked and mushy on the other. my date had same issue with his fish. street corn was disappointing. not the usual quality.
2023-04-28,SimonW,4.0,"a good reliable restaurant that is usually available for a reservation.  food and service are always very good even if priced a bit on the high side.
the framingham location is better than the chestnut hill if you prefer a quieter location with better spacing between diners and easier for reservations."
2023-04-27,MROB,4.0,"good food, good service and very allergy aware which is comforting."
2023-04-22,Beanpot,4.0,food was very good-bang bang cauliflower was fantastic. service was excellent. exceeded our expectations.
2023-04-22,KarenS,2.0,one out of three at our table enjoyed their meal. rainbow trout was delicious. swordfish and salmon were lousy. can’t get baked potato or fish chowder anymore. it’s not what it used to be. disappointing!  service was great though!
2023-04-21,Judy,5.0,we had a very nice dinner - the food was great and the restaurant was very quiet.  we had an excellent server.  i have had him before and he is great - funny and very accommodating.   i personnally like this restaurant because it is quiet.  i do not like the bar atmosphere in most of the restaurants today.
2023-04-21,Dave,3.0,whole belly clams were overly salty.  rice pilaf and scallops were tastless.  clam chowder and crab cakes were great.
2023-04-16,RhondaD,5.0,"legal seafood never fails.  great food and great service.  a bit overpriced, but that’s partly due to the name.  should offer a ‘lazy lobster’ menu option for lobster lovers at a seafood restaurant."
2023-04-15,OpenStudio,4.0,delicious food and great service.  whole thing from start to finish took one hour.
2023-04-15,DavidE,5.0,"good, service and atmosphere was great. 
the cost was high. i think that there should be more entrees that are moderately price. 
we will be back but not as often as if prices were lower."
2023-04-14,OpenTable Diner,3.0,not what it was. limited menu items now. need to have some better menu choices.
2023-04-14,RuthT,5.0,everyone from front reception to servers are working hard and trying g to make dining out an enjoyable experience.
2023-04-13,FoodieGirl,5.0,the waiter was amazing with the kids. loved him. jeff maybe?
2023-04-12,SergeK,3.0,"food was great. there were two of us.
waitstaff kept coming back to see what they could clear from the table while one person was still eating.
we had to tell them please do not return until all of us were done."
2023-04-12,CraigB,3.0,"there was nothing wrong with the meal or service but it has gone from being a special night out to average at best.  menu is really has nothing exciting, almost no way to get a combination of seafood except for fried, portions were relatively small especially given the high prices.  the service was average, the food was fine but there are a lot of other places in the area that have dishes i crave for lower prices and exceptional service.  legals has gone from exciting and vibrant to boring and plain."
2023-04-09,Truthful,5.0,we can  always depend on legal for fresh food and good service.
2023-04-09,DeniseS,5.0,"we had a great time, excellent food and loved the board room!"
2023-04-08,Meems,4.0,"always a nice place to dine. brianna provided great service. the calamari was a little bit heavily fried (we’ve had better there), crab cake sliders were yummy; the simply grilled salmon fresh and delicious (although this time did not ask how we liked it cooked), haddock anna’s way was excellent as was chocolate pudding cake and boston cream pie. wine selection is very nice. as it was a saturday night it was a bit noisy but it was ok."
2023-04-08,melissaa,2.0,"we waited forever for our waiter to even acknowledge us. so long another waiter came over to see if we being helped.  no rolls no water , drink spilled all over table when delivered.  never asked if we wanted another drink when empty glasses sat.  swordfish so over cooked it was hard to swallow green beans cold.  very disappointed for the bill we paid."
2023-04-07,Mike,2.0,"first off the food was really good but it ultimately did not make up for the very slow, careless and inattentive service. we were seated on time and the waitress was right over before we even looked at the drink list. she asked if we needed a minute to decide and we said yes. that’s where it all went downhill. 15 min later she was back and we put our drink and appetizer orders in. 2 cups of clam chowder, a salad and a shrimp cocktail with three cocktails. it took 20 minutes for the chowder and salad to come out and another 10 for the shrimp cocktail. just as we were finishing up the appetizers our first round of drinks made their way to the table. we put our entree orders in. baked haddock, fried clam dinner and baked stuff lobster (server was unaware it came with two sides so i had to tell her before she walked away). about 25 minutes later the food arrived, no claw cracker or bib for the lobster so i waited and waited and waited for a server to come by. finally got the bib and fork but no claw cracker. after 10 more minutes that arrived. we put another drink order in. we finished dinner and still no drinks. we waited. we waited more while sitting in front of plates and waiting for some to go containers. finally had to get up to find the server and let her know to cancel the drinks and bring the check with some to go containers. manger came over and was apologetic and offered $40 off the bill. that was a nice gesture and appreciated but it was still $200 for a dinner where all we talked about was what we were missing and how long we were waiting. we loved this place but since the sale to a restaurant group the service has suffered immensely. just not that same pride there once was. doubt we will be going back which is a shame since the food was very good. likely sole proprietor from now on."
2023-04-07,charlesa,5.0,"jeff at the framingham location is a great server.  personality, attentiveness, and accomidating."
2023-04-02,JenniferG,5.0,"must be very good management here in framingham for every time we have gone for dinner (not too often, maybe 5-6x past year or so) greeting at the door (we always make reservations online) is quick, courteous and kind, friendly, and accommodating; service has always (i know it is ‘all-encompassing’ but in this case true) impeccable! food always meets (or exceeds) our expectations. how nice is that?! ambiance/facilities clean and comfortable; easy to move around; booths: a quiet private touch in places. certainly strongly recommend, but ‘sea’ for yourselves."
2023-03-31,MichelleN,5.0,we enjoyed our family dinner for my birthday. rarely disappoints.
2023-03-27,Miltonfam,5.0,"we had a delightful dinner with friends in one of the comfortable booths.  the seafood, vegetables and salad were fresh and delicious. our server could not have been nicer.  legals is definitely one of our favorite places to dine.  thank you."
2023-03-25,NancyR,4.0,food was very good. service was great. just not enough food for the price. after spending $40 for just the entree and tip i leave still hungry !  i wish you would bring back the baked potato.
2023-03-25,Traveller19,2.0,"we so wanted to enjoy seafood on our trip to massachusetts! meals were mediocre at best.  fried oysters were tiny and rubbery, baked haddock (gluten free version) flavorless, fries soggy and seemed undercooked, steak nearly impossible to cut.  we were celebrating my mom’s birthday, 7 of us.  she had a good meal of shrimp pasta and the fried scallops were also a hit, but everyone else’s meal was mediocre at best.  great thing was gluten free rolls served hot were a rarity for dining out and much appreciated.  i will never return.  server was great but food not and this is not an inexpensive outing."

2023-03-17,Bostonian,3.0,"price far exceeds quality, just not worth it at all. far better choices at far better value. i had a gift card and why i went because it’s been a disappointment for years at any ls location- over rated and tourist trap."

2023-02-17,Roger,2.0,"well,... this member of the legal seafoods' family has served us well for years by preparing custom-made, gluten-free lump crab cakes for my wife, but on our most recent visit they failed us: the request she phoned in to the reservations desk on the day of wasn't relayed to the kitchen. we'll give them another chance - mistakes happen - but it was a letdown."
2023-02-16,AnthonyC,4.0,"the service and ambiance were fantastic. we had 12 oysters and all were tasty and fresh. we were a table of 3. the two of the dinners were up to the standards we expect from legal. the third was not. it was the sesame encrusted ahi tuna with szechuan green beans. the green beans were delicious. unfortunately the tuna was not. some of the pieces had a gray color and instead of the purple one would expect from this dish. non of the tune tasted fresh. it was a disappointment for a $39 entre. 

two diners shared the a piece of boston cream pie. it was delicious."
2023-02-14,Tina,3.0,"understanding that all restaurants have had price increases recently, it still seems like legal is a bad value for what you get.  the portions are on the smaller side to average but their prices are really high for what you get. my husband and i shared an appetizer (tuna poke), two entrees (tuna for him, crabcake for me) and a dessert (apple bread pudding that was pretty dry and flavorless) last night.  without any alcohol, the total was over $120 before tip.  there was nothing really outstanding about the meal or service.  the music was also pretty loud and a bit bizarre for valentine's day (no romantic vibe at all)."
2023-02-11,somethingoranother85,2.0,"over rated, over prices, small portions and just lack luster over all"
2023-02-10,TheHappyCouple,5.0,as always everything was delicious. still love this place after many years of dining here.
2023-02-04,TripAdvisor,5.0,"loving the stuffed twin lobster tails they put on the menu last year.  stuffed with some shrimp, scallops and the breading is perfect.  was fantastic last night.  libation and service rounded out a great meal.

very highly recommended"
2023-02-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,wonderful place. was looking for some good seafood while working in the boston area and found it. scallops were incredible.
2023-01-30,doctor,1.0,"the lobster roll was not a half of pound,and tasted like fish"
2023-01-28,Lisa,1.0,"we had a large party (8) so we took a bit longer to order but the service was so slow, often looking for our waiter and when entrees were brought out, one was missing and after more than 8 minutes, we had to flag down anyone we could find to get our last entree. the food is historically delicious at legal but tonight was different. the rolls were stale, the spicy drink was not spicy, and my fish tacos were served on stale hard “soft tacos”."
2023-01-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the food was excellent and the service was great!  highly recommend for any occasion!
2023-01-26,Bostoncouple1,4.0,"food was so much more interesting than before pandemic
didn’t realize under new ownership
we were very pleased"
2023-01-25,mark,3.0,way overpriced for two fish tacos.  probably the worst fish taco we had in a long time. we went to legal seafood years ago and we’re very excited to go. so disappointed.  service: kept asking us if we wanted more drinks even when glasses were 3/4 full.
2023-01-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,it was my 30th birthday dinner with me and my husband!!
2023-01-22,Bruce,4.0,"birthday celebration for my wife. she had been visiting friends and snacked with them before arriving for dinner.
she enjoyed her oysters but only ordered that. perhaps as a result there was no recognition of her birthday."
2023-01-22,Bottomline222,2.0,we are regulars at legal and have been for over 20 years. the steamed littleneck and ouster rockefeller were excellent as was the nut crusted salmon my wife enjoyed for dinner. i ordered the lobster roll. quite frankly paying  $42 for an all claw meat lobster roll is something i will never do again. the lobster roll was heavy on celery and low on taste. a great disappointment
2023-01-21,PeterC,5.0,"the food, service, and setting were excellent, as usual!"
2023-01-21,melissaa,4.0,everything was great except for the bake stuffed lobster.  waste of money.  stuffing was mushy and cold as if it was spooned in after lobster cooked. butter was cold.  not worth the value/ money unfortunately.
2023-01-21,out2dine,4.0,"we dine at legal seafood often and usually have an excellent meal. this time our fish entrees were disappointing. the clam chowder was excellent and was the best part of the dinner. we both ordered grilled fish entrees. the grilled sea scallops were small and very bland. if it was served with a sauce or compliment, it would have been much better. broccoli au gratin was served in a bowl and was difficult to cut. the grilled swordfish was dry and might have been much better with a sauce. our server was prompt and gave us very good service. on a positive note, we signed up for the legal loyalty reward program and received one complimentary chowder."
2023-01-21,Steve,1.0,"great waiter but he made a lot of mistakes
tuna was cooked well done.  what?!  who cooks sushi grade tuna well done?  i love legal's but go back to this restaurant ever."
2023-01-20,OpenTable Diner,3.0,food was only fair. salmon over cooked. scallops had not taste and overcooked. very disappointing.
2023-01-15,loulou,3.0,hddock their specialty way too well done hard to enjoy
2023-01-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent - celebration of 4 year old birthday. legal served special desert with candles- not expected. staff gracious and food de-lish!

2023-01-07,JaneB,5.0,"our table was a two person table in the bar area... which is fine. there were people gathered two and three deep around the bar, awaiting a table, and it made us feel a bit crowded.... at one point people bumped into our table trying to avoid severs going by."

2023-01-02,KatieD,1.0,"after eating lunch here, my dad had an allergic reaction to something but we were not aware that he has any food allergies. when i called to investigate, asking for the ingredients of the dish he ate, they could not tell me any actual items in the entree, just a list of categories like fish, dairy, and gluten - which was not helpful since we know he is not allergic to those ""common allergens"". very disappointing visit to a restaurant we otherwise liked in the past."
2023-01-01,out2dine,5.0,we enjoyed a delicious and relaxing seafood dinner at legals. the server gave us great service. the cup of clam chowder is excellent with plenty of clams and definitely worth ordering. the 1.5 pound steamed lobsters were delicious and portion was generous.
2023-01-01,EvaK,5.0,my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  the service and atmosphere were great.
2023-01-01,jsands222,5.0,legal seafood continues to maintain high quality and fresh food. on new years eve our reservation was kept and we were seated immediately. our server greeted us and took our order. our food came out nice and hot. both service and food were wonderful. will continue to return.

2022-12-30,GRF4,2.0,"disappointed, this was the first time we have been back to legal seafood in four years due to poor service and food quality back then.
 i do want to say our waitress was very good. however the food quality and the managers lack of concern was the reason for this review. i got the surf and turf for my meal. grilled shrimp and the filet. if you are going to offer a meat meal you should be able to cook it correctly. the filet was ordered medium rare, it was very well done when it arrived. the waitress took it away and the manager came by to let me know they would be remaking it. she was not very apologetic and only offered to get me my sides to eat while they remade the filet. meanwhile my wife was trying to not eat while i watched her with no food in front of me. very uncomfortable for both of us. after the second filet came out the manager asked me to cut into it. it was correct but the quality of this piece of filet was not good it was rather chewy and less than six ounces at best, it was definitely not a prime cut, select at best. i know it is a seafood restaurant but if you put different items on your menu you should be able to cook them properly. it will be a while before we go back. the lack of concern from the manager was disheartening."
2022-12-29,PauloFromMassachusetts,4.0,"the food was very good as usual, but what was outstanding was the service provided by mike n.! fun, flexible, understanding, clever, great doing his job!"
2022-12-28,RasP,5.0,food was great.  service was great.  noticed a large price hike on the menu.  hope this hike is not seen when the inflationary pressures are alleviated
2022-12-27,DonnaS,5.0,"our waitress was the best. the food was excellent. the drinks also were very good.
make a reservation."
2022-12-27,johnd,2.0,"we have been customers of lsf for literally decades and the framingham location since it opened. it has definitely deteriorated on many levels over the years and our most recent visit was the worst. i had indicated on my reservation that it was a special occasion/birthday....but that went by unnoticed. not terrible, just disappointing. 
the real issue was the wait for our main course and the end result. we passed on apps because we had another commitment that evening. we placed our order promptly, no special requirements or ""asks"". then we waited.....and waited.....and waited. at last our food arrived and it was....cold. and there is nothing worse than cold cooked fish. nothing. unfortunately we did not have the time or inclination to complain. we're just going to move on. i would not recommend and suggest you think twice because ""it ain't cheap"" and is frankly not worth it."
2022-12-24,JudyD,5.0,"great good, great ambiance, a little noisy. excellent value."
2022-12-24,Kandace,4.0,"portion size was small, for the price. food arrived fast. it was better than previous year’s christmas eve service."

2022-12-14,Libby,4.0,"we always enjoy a meal with family at legal seafood and will continue to go there when we can.  we were seated at a table that was clearly in the traffic pattern of restaurant staff who were working and having a meeting in a private room.  after we asked, the waitstaff kindly moved us to a table that was better for our party of 5- mostly senior citizens.  the menu is somewhat limited now- going back to legal's roots perhaps?  ...but the prices certainly haven't gone back to those roots :-)    some of the food was excellent- calamari, crab cakes were especially good,  but the drinks and lobster items were not up to the quality we have come to expect- especially for the price.  we had a good night out with family and enjoyed ourselves but it was a bit pricey."
2022-12-13,GregR,3.0,"we specified it was a special occasion on our opentable reservation, but the restaurant never acknowledged the occasion.   also, they seated us as a couple in a room with three big parties.      not the best ambiance as a result."
2022-12-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent.  just overpriced
2022-12-11,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"our server was amazing!  but i am so disappointed at the changes to the menu and quality.  it’s been a while since going there.  the only potato on the menu is french fries.  the non-fish eater of the group could choose between 2 beef items. the kids menu had the most variety.  the anna’s way haddock had so little breading and seasoning on it compare to the past and the tomato is no longer chopped up but served as a big thick slice that might as well be put on a burger.  the clam chowder was really good though.  given the changes, i am not surprised how empty it was and the prices are even higher than they used to be."
2022-12-11,YSKim,5.0,"food was prepared to our exact order and delivered to us timely.  our server judith was friendly, efficient and professional."
2022-12-10,GeorgeC,5.0,"both the food and the service were excellent. also, they were able to find a nice table for two near the windows in the bar area, where we felt we had a lot of privacy."
2022-12-09,EricaL,3.0,"very disappointed! seemed very over priced for what you got. my husband got fishermans platter and it was juat ok. 2 shrimp, a piece of fish, 2 scallops, and a handfull of calamari rings. i got the lobster mac....and though the presentation was nice, the actual meal was probably the worst and moat expensive lobster mac i have ever had. there was a reasonable amount of lobster, but the mac was dry and very bland, and they left the fish poo in the shell....honestly had i known it was stuffed in a lobster shell i probably would not have got it, but it did not say that in the description"
2022-12-07,Thomas,2.0,"living on the east coast i have been to and tasted some of the best seafood in the area. legal seafood is an over priced averaged chain restaurant. 
the waiter was nice but very scripted. 
food was average for what they charge. if you’re a seafood lover, and you’re from new england. don’t waste your $$. also waiter never asked if we need more drinks. just came to gather the plates. 
it was my first and last time."
2022-12-05,Carol,5.0,service was impeccable. dishes we had questions about were described by server in detail. food was delicious and pacing was just right.
2022-12-04,MarieClaudeB,3.0,"the food was much better under the previous owner. the menu has changed too, with more meat items and fewer fish dishes. some desserts have been kept from the original menu but some like the boston cream pie are not as delicious as they used to be. overall, the ambiance is the same as before but the food has gone down in quality."
2022-12-03,David,4.0,"i ordered the ciopino which was supposed to come w/ lobster tail but i got a claw. mentioned this to our server & was ignored.

it was a little pricey, but i would definitely go back."

2022-11-27,SueL,3.0,"eight of us, 7 adults and one 6 year old child had lunch at legal seafood. the prices have always been high  there but it was the birthday person’s choice of where to go for lunch. the cost of  yesterday’s meal was astronomical. $10 for a cup of lobster bisque in which there was one remnant of lobster meat, $16 for one alcoholic beverage, and $18 for a greek salad with chicken. $11 for a caesar salad before shrimp was added! i don’t even want to know how much it was to add the shrimp. i was shocked at the total bill."

2022-11-26,DorothyK,2.0,definitely not the same place. food was bland and looked as if it were thrown on the plate .real lack of flavor in rice and trout. sweet potatoes were fine.  i used to love to come here. waiter did try to improve food with condiments.
2022-11-25,LACatty,2.0,"very disappointed in the food   the whole clam bellies were so tough they were not chewable in the portion size is noticeably different less value
also had the fish tacos as soon as you picked it up, fell right through the taco shell had to eat with a fork

2022-11-14,John,2.0,"legal has always been reliably good.  this time it was disappointing. i had hot tea, caesar salad, and grilled scallops (8).  my wife had a glass of wine, french fries, tuna encrusted with sesame seeds and green beans soaked in some kind of sauce.  everything was tasty, but not outstanding. including 18% tip $136.  really? portions were small.  we had to ask for water (mine never came).  we wore our coats all evening as the place was freezing (nobody noticed).  to top it off, my wife developed a migraine later that evening, usually triggered by msg.  we had been warned by friends that legal could be hit or miss.  sadly this was a miss."
2022-11-13,Kitty,3.0,we have been going to various legal locations for over 25 years now and the food is always good but ambiance lacking.  last night we were entertaining guests from the mid west and we ended up at a noisy booth right outside the kitchen so that we all went home smelling like a fish.  dishes kept being dropped during dinner and they were sweeping the carpet while we were finishing at 8:00 p.m.   i was disappointed and hope next time will be better.
2022-11-13,JOHN,3.0,"food was good, everyone at the table enjoyed it. i had the crab cake combo, which was good. the shrimp were overcooked and tough, but the scallops and crab cake were very good."
2022-11-12,Wolfman,3.0,"came to legal after a 2-year hiatus.  unfortunately, the food ad the restaurant is not the same.  it starts with the greeting and ends with the ""thank you"".  we entered with reservations and the ""harried"" teen told us to stand aside while he seated other guests, other tables were being cleaned.   after waiting patiently for 15 min, watching people with no reservations being seated, we approached another (harried) woman who looked like she knew what she was doing, and magically got seated right away....at the worst table possible - the one next to the kitchen.  our server (also rushed) came by several times to take our drink order and our dinner order.  i mistakenly ordered the ""spicy fish and chips"".  this used to be one of legal's best  items on the menu.  had i looked at the fancy new menu, i would have noticed that ""spicy fish and chips"" were no longer on the menu.  well, my ""spicy"" fish and chips arrived - sprinkled with cajun seasoning.  i actually don't know what was worse - the cajun catastophe, the mushy fish or the cold, hard french fries.  the coleslaw was very good, but it didn't justify the $27 cost of the meal.  my wife enjoyed the crabcake sliders (she said they were better than gordon ramsey's kitchen).  the whole experience was blahzee.  it used to be fun to come here - the service was professional and the food outstanding by all measures.  not anymore.  sayonara legal seafoods..."
2022-11-12,jonr,2.0,"food was all good, seafood seemed fresh, and perfectly cooked. the wellfleet oysters were excellent, the crab cake appetizer had minimal filler and was good sized, and the clam chowder while not excellent was a solid b. the diners with me had the baked haddock and shrimp scampi and also enjoyed the their meals.

the service was awful. the frequency of trips to the table was way too low, they forgot to order one of our appetizers, the food came out 1 plate at a time with 15 minutes between the 1st plate and last plate showing up. waiter wasn’t engaged or seemingly interested in being there.

we were tucked into a back room with super dated tables, low ceilings, it felt like an old cafeteria.

beer, liquor, and wine selection was sub par at best. i

prices were way too high. maybe justifiable with better ambiance and service. the lack of craft beer selection, and good signature cocktails is just not on par with price point and expectations."
2022-11-12,sneezeme,1.0,"not a fan
my husband wanted to come back after two very disappointing meals. 

i was more than disappointed 

the salad was okay

lobster roll 100 % claw meat and sucked

so disappointed since the berkowitz sold out

2022-11-09,CraigB,3.0,it is really a shame how legals has gone from top notch seafood dining experience to average at best. the menu is now very limited and waiters seem to always be apologizing that old favorites are no longer offered (even going as far as saying they get asked for those dishes all the time). the food is fine but it is no overpriced and the service has dropped significantly - it is ok but nothing special any longer. so sad how a restaurant that used to be a special place to eat is now not even on our top 10 list.
2022-11-09,Juppstar,4.0,my guest and i enjoyed lunch at legal. my guest thought the haddock was wonderful.  i had the greek salad with blackened salmon. the salmon was delicious but salad had garbanzo beans; and i mean tons of them. detracted from salad.  our server was excellent.

service staff were all friendly and competent.  no rushing of taking orders.
     just take your time and enjoy the experience.  
just a great place overall. 


only suggestion:  restaurant could consider offering onion rings as an alternative to french fries with the fried seafood selections."

2022-10-16,Happymeal,3.0,"service was excellent.  regarding our meals, one criticism was the steamed broccoli was severely undercooked to the point it was almost raw.  however after mentioning this to our server she immediately replaced with a better prepared offering.   the second criticism was the sea scallops were in the 20/30 count size range which was disappointing given the $36 entree price tag.  i expected more from lsf.  the bread pudding dessert was one of the best i've ever had.  so overall i'd say it was a good experience, not great."
2022-10-15,EllenC,3.0,"the last 2 times we had dinner at legal we were disappointed. appetizers were good, dinners were not great"
2022-10-15,LesleyN,2.0,"my husbands salmon was raw when he had it ordered medium well, my oyster special was so salty was inedible, this is the 2nd time in a month that food was awful we live nearby and usually go 2-3 times a month not any more our server was excellent and very apologetic was not her fault and gave her full tip for what the total meal would have cost, they did offer me other choices but with a mouthful of salt not able to taste anything else. not going back anytime soon, they lost a frequent customer,and by the way the maitre d was rude"
2022-10-15,CatherineA,3.0,"my husband and i grew up in boston and we've always adored legal's. but our recent visit to the framingham restaurant was lackluster.  i don't expect great service anywhere these days -- so no surprises when the wait staff forget the lmon we requested for water or mixed up our orders. what did surprise me was how blah the food was. we ordered three salads - two caesars and a greek topped with salmon or colossal shrimp. the shrimp were extra large not colossal or even jumbo. the salmon was nicely cooked but sat atop a salad drenched in dressing, rendering the greens limp and tasteless. in the past the legal's menu has included a mix of classics (fried clams, etc.) with some contemporary twists (poke bowl with quinoa, etc.) there was nothing inventive on our menu this time, which was disappointing. the dining room was tired, filled with empty tables and tellingly, there were no young people in the restaurant - perhaps a reflection of legal's high prices. a mix of high-prices and lower-prices items (shared plates?) would help lure younger diners. here's hoping this beloved chain gets its groove back! i love legal's and want a better experience."
2022-10-13,KevinQ,5.0,"always good food and service 
as it was a business meeting with 5 attendees. the low noise level was especially a positive. in fact one of the reasons for selecting"
2022-10-12,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"bartender was slow and inattentive. chicken or bacon in my sandwich was charred and tasted so. bartender offered to swap it. i declined. rather than take the $17 sandwich off the bill, or even one of the $14 glasses of wine, he took off... $6 of the oysters that were on special. very disappointing."
2022-10-11,Bottomline222,4.0,overall very good. we both ordered the lobster roll which was good but consisted of lobster claw meat with no body meat. it changes the taste and texture. would not order it again.

2022-10-08,BobH,4.0,"the lobster bisque was terrible. the roux was way too dark, almost bitter, it took over the whole bisque, making it actually taste like it was in the pot way too long. the wait staff was phenomenal as expected though..."
2022-10-07,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"arrived 10 minutes early in empty restaurant, made us wait 20 minutes to sit a table in a room with multiple empty tables. no table cloth, paper napkins, ridiculous prices. won’t be back."

2022-10-03,PattyP,4.0,"we love legal seafood! this last visit however, we found the portions were considerably smaller and the servers were not well-versed in the menu.

we understand staffing issues post pandemic, and that the cost of food is rising, but one of the items i order regularly, the cesar salad with the addition of shrimp (an additional $12, the salad came with 4 small shrimp. in august there were 8 shrimp.). it was also oysterfest. the oysters were $3.50. that did not feel special.

i know it is a hard time for restaurants and i have no solution to offer."
2022-10-02,LouiseB,3.0,"is this really legal seafood. no steamers, no fish  chowder, no onion strings. what is going on here. the scrod was overly salty, the mexican corn was awful.  a photo of fish in the tank. that is pathetic. no baked potatoes.  seriously, not good."
2022-10-02,Susan32,1.0,"we have been to this restaurant many times over the years. tonight was a huge disappointment. the food came out at the wrong times, my entree was overcooked (and was the wrong order at first). they brought out 18 oysters in one plate for 3 people.  one entree came out 20 minutes late (a kids meal at that). they brought the wrong wine. when it came to dessert they had run out of cake and only served 2 small substitutes. no apologies either from the manager."
2022-10-02,Foodfan,5.0,"great experience at legal sea foods, last night.  sat in the bar area and dined while watching the pats game.  food was excellent:  clam chowder, salads, salmon, oysters, mussels, lobster rolls... everything was flavorful, fresh and portions were appropriate to generous.  server trina l. was awesome:  super friendly, efficient and helpful with food recommendations.  we will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,Gourmand,1.0,"a long time customer but not for the future.  my order arrived with both side orders wrong.  the clam fritter appetizer was almost hard as a rock.  the gumbo and scallop entrees were tasteless.  only the rolls and clam chowder reminded us of the "" old "" legal prior to the sale to new owners. we have tried several times within the last 6 months  or so only to be repeatedly disappointed."
2022-09-30,David,4.0,"rolls bask to top of the class. clam chowder, usually a favorite of mine, arrived lukewarm. stuffed sole entry is delicious."
2022-09-29,ScottyP,5.0,"my guest was running 10 minutes late, so i went in and got our reservation. the hostess station staff were very friendly and i was able to choose the type of table i wanted.  our server stopped by and i told him my guest would be here in about 10 minutes. he brought over 2 waters and was very friendly. my guest arrived and he gave us time to chat and look over the menu.  she chose the baked stuffed lobster tails on special and i ordered the crab cake combo, substituting rice with the street corn.

both our dinners were fantastic! the service was second to none. really looking forward to visiting again soon. i’ve always had a very nice experience in the framingham location."
2022-09-29,JustinW,5.0,"pleasantly and surprisingly empty last evening, service was exceptionally pleasant and helpful, first time i’ve tried raw clams, not sure i’d advocate doing so without sauce again. this is about 5 times in the last two weeks i’ve been in for one reason or another and each has been great"
2022-09-29,ChowderHead,4.0,"my third time at this restaurant since the ownership change.  something good has happened at this location.  the staff were especially attentive and friendly, the food was excellent, and the ambience in the bar area was back to the ""old days"", with a crowded bar and many high-tops occupied.  we were at our favorite low-top in the bar area, which is quiet and near where the staff walk by frequently.  we all had the shrimp gumbo, and it was delicious.  spicy sauce, but not too much cayenne, with tasty bits of chorizo and perfectly cooked (i.e., not overdone) shrimp.  legal's still has the best rolls around, and bottomless iced tea.  we lingered for 90 minutes over lunch, and plan to return again soon."
2022-09-29,Mariswon,1.0,i have been coming to legal for years and years.  this is the first time i have ever been sickened by it.  the ladies room was disgusting you would have to pay me to go in there again!  there is almost no help....we were left sitting before we ordered for over an hour....because we were chatting...no one came to check on us....i was with clients so it was uncomfortable.  as for the food...the greenbean ends were not chopped off..so i had to bite of the ends to eat them.  legal seafood can no longer be considered a very nice place to take a client or to eat for a superior lunch or dinner.  i will never go again.
2022-09-28,AngeloM,3.0,"i think food presentation needs work.

the food is fine, however it is trading on brand, it’s too expensive for the area!

competition located in worcester, rates better and deserves the expensive menu items.

since the shops were sold, i find less friendly contact and just gouging of prices.

need to address this short coming!

ps remove the lobster ravioli from the menu it is absolutely a poor combination of veggies and minimal lobster meat in pasta!

disappointed.

very highly recommended"
2022-08-28,Katherine,5.0,"first, we appreciated the flexibility of the legal seafood staff as our group size changed.  they really did everything to accommodate us from seating some of the group earlier as they requested to adding additional people who arrived late.  our server was very helpful with food and drink suggestions and obliged with separate checks when we asked for them.  the group ordered a variety of seafood dishes from trout to mussels to tacos to the raw tuna offerings.  everything delicious.  everyone happy."

2022-08-05,KarenM,4.0,"we like to go to legals at both dedham and framingham especially because my daughter has celiacs and knows that their fried food is all gluten free.  legals is  very reliable this way.  there were 7 of us celebrating my husbands birthday in framingham.  we were very satisfied with our server lisa. she was very accommodating.  most of the meals were up to par.  i was surprised the bang bang cauliflower appetizer had only a few giant pieces therefore making it difficult to share. 

but i was so very disappointed to take my husband and family there for his birthday dinner of fried clams because they were shriveled up and over cooked....no bellies were evident.   i did not know this until we were home (or i might have sent them back), and i’m guessing he didn’t want to send them back and make the rest of the family wait for another meal for him.  

we have eaten in dedham and experienced the same thing with the friend clams .

so going forward we would never order fried clams there again."

2022-08-04,KateG,2.0,"we are a family of six that dined at your location last night for a birthday party. while expensive, we always thought of legals has a great place for excellent seafood. we were very disappointed. the lobster macaroni had about three bites of decent size lobster meat well there was too much dried out macaroni and cheese. the scallops that were grilled were bland and a bit overdone. the shrimp scampi had way too much lemon added to the sauce, the clam chowder was good but unfortunately our two orders of fried calamari were very greasy as an appetizer. we were very disappointed with the quality of the food. i doubt we would be back as it is not justified in quality versus price. our server was very nice but they were so disappointed with the money we were spending on the poor quality of food."

2022-07-29,SteveR,5.0,only restaurant to serve lobster mac and cheese in a freaking lobster shell including the tail.  consistently great food regardless of location.
2022-07-29,JohnC,4.0,"don't let four stars fool in this case - this would easily be 5 in most places, but legal, taking pride in their craft, could still do better.  i remember before pandemic offers of fresh pepper for dishes, conversational waitstaff, piping hot dinner rolls, and ridiculous attention to things like drink refills.  none of these were bad - in fact as i enjoyed, they were still quite good, but legal has set a standard that it didn't quite meet.  some of this is even forgiven by a very full house on a friday night, a testament to their quality.

again, don't let this dissuade you from eating here - this is meant for management to know they have room to get back to where they were.  this is still very much the place to eat if you like seafood, and especially if you have dietary restrictions.  the lobster mac is still fabulous, and the new swordfish is quite excellent."

2022-07-08,Traveler,3.0,"still isn't what  it used to be. new owners/ management seems to have caught on that the legal name wasn't going to carry the degraded menu and food they put forth originally.   they brought back fish like cod and halibut, fresh tuna etc, instead of pedaling garbage fish like pollack ( though thats still what they are using in the fish in chips.. instead of cod or halibut) .  they also lost the awful doughy fried ""beer"" batter and did prepare our fried sole with the original legal lighter batter.  so while the food
is better than it has been, it isn't close to what it used to be. we used to be once a weekers... we only went back recently b/c there was too much of a wait a captain mardens... legal was half empty on a friday night. im not sure we'll be back again."

2022-07-03,ChrisG,4.0,"i enjoyed my meal (grilled scallops), but was disappointed in the butter potato side.  i enjoyed it at a different legal location, but in framingham, the potatoes were dry and flavorless.  i do love the szechuan beans however.  maybe next time i will just ask for 2 servings of the delicious beans, when 2 sides are offered. the other 4 people in the party seemed to enjoy their meals."
2022-06-30,Ballou,5.0,i had the mexican cod- delicious! my wife had the grilled salmon with jasmine rice and cole slaw. desert was our favorite ice cream bonbons! judy was our server. she is absolutely the best. very attentive and thoughtful. the manager came by to ask how we enjoyed our meal- nice touch! we will be back!  ps the front desk was very helpful getting our favorite booth!
2022-06-28,CathyM,5.0,great martinis and love that you have gluten free options!
2022-06-26,AliceB,4.0,"i'll start with the positive.  the service was excellent.  the restaurant had ample staff and everyone we interacted with was warm, wanted to help and was responsive.

unfortunately, the food just isn't what it use to be at legal.  we have 4 appetizers, 3 entrees and 1 dessert and none was particularly good.  bland and unispiring, every dish. the portions have gotten a bit smaller and that was absolutely fine.   the prices aren't for bland food.  we didn't find the prices particularly high, relative to similar restaurants but the food should have been tastier.  

as a result, we won't be returning for quite some time."
2022-06-26,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"extremely disappointed with the food. the best part of the meal was the bread and rice. we have been customers of legal’s for over 40 years and the last couple visits under the new management have been very disappointing in terms of quality, quantity taste and presentation of the dishes."
2022-06-25,GregoryM,4.0,dinner before a movie.  food was very good.  service was terrific.
2022-06-23,TexasAMFan,5.0,there is so many choices at legal seafood.  the test kitchen section is definitely a place to start if you are feeling adventurous.  the go-to is the clam chowder and the crab cakes.
2022-06-23,ChartHouse,5.0,what better way to celebrate my birthday but with a terrific meal and service at legal’s. seems like the menu had some new items one of which was the street corn cod that 2 people in our party ordered who said it was delicious. i had the tuna sashimi style and it was amazing. definitely recommend legal’s all around!
2022-06-22,MuhammadK,2.0,the whole experience was horibleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2022-06-22,TripAdvisor,4.0,"still enjoy legal but see some signs of it slipping over the past few visits... service is still great, but think the kitchen is slipping a bit and some product changes, like smaller shrimp aren't for the better.  they'd be wise to catch this because if i'm noticing, one of legal's biggest fans, then could indicate trouble ahead."
2022-06-22,239jr,3.0,"undercooked food.serice was just okay, server really didn't take interest that my food was undercooked and not to my liking"
2022-06-20,Jays,2.0,"i wrote a review for legal framingham....to sum it up, if you've dined at legal harborside or test kitchen in the seaport and are expecting a similar experience with the legal brand at the framingham site, you need to be prepared for a significant step down in menu, food and especially the quality and experience of the service team.  if the seaport is a 10 the framingham is a 3.  big disappointment and will never go to the framingham site again.  it's worth the trip into the city for the food, selection, service, etc..."
2022-06-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we frequent legal because there is no fresher seafood. it
2022-06-19,KathyA,3.0,"overpriced. the haddock was cooked with too many bread crumbs. the potatoes were not cooked enough and too firm. the mounds of broccoli on the plate were barely cooked and too hard to chew. the boston cream pie was the best part of the meal. service was wonderful and i tipped high for her service. i will not return, this is not the same legal seafood i knew and loved."
2022-06-18,CHRISTINEJ,5.0,"this was a fathers day dinner for my husband, brought my son (not his) very nice service was great, food was exceptional . will definitely return."
2022-06-17,Rarphantom,3.0,business lunch and food was good. the fish sandwich and chicken sandwich were basic. atmosphere is ready for a makeover.  chowder was also good.  probably the best in the area which is why it’s still there.
2022-06-15,JerryS,4.0,"when it was lobster day, i was hoping for one with prices down a bit but i guess with these costs these days,it was not meant to be.  but i settled for lobster bisque soup. judy was very good."
2022-06-14,Hudsontravelers,5.0,"food was  fresh, well prepared, and interesting new menu offerings.
they were flexible  about changes we requested (all tentacles for calamari, extra broth for mussels)

they boxed our take home items in kitchen.  we do not like to have to do it ourselves at the table.

nice touches. signs of a great restaurant."
2022-06-11,OpenTable Diner,5.0,had dinner at the bar and had a blast!
2022-06-10,JohnS,5.0,great meal and even better service. our waiter jeffrey was the best
2022-06-09,khaledM,4.0,"very good food and selection, the service was rushed towards the end to allow follow up table reservation ( we did not over extend our stay!) 
still very good service and food."
2022-06-08,BeverlyK,5.0,"always a treat to celebrate a special occasion at legal seafood.  
the whole dining experience from beginning to end was wonderful and our server, katherine, was terrific - personable, polite and exceptionally accommodating.
we were celebrating 3 birthdays and it was so much fun - our dinners were the best - always fresh fish and the presentation so lovely.  i find the framingham location much more comfortable than the wellesley location - more spacious and more seafood selections.  kudos to all of you and please keep up the excellent work.  i know we are going through difficult times with shortages of staff and hiring issues, but your staff is always top notch!!!  thank you."
2022-06-06,out2dine,4.0,"our open table got us right in and we told them we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. we were seated across from a table with young children, so we asked to be moved when it got noisy. they checked with the hostess and moved us to a more quiet table.

we had the large steamed lobsters which were very delicious. some of the lobster was cut open so it was easier to work with. it also comes baked stuffed. the clam chowder is always delicious and worth getting. we very disappointed that they didn’t offer a lobster bake entree with steamers, mussels and corn on the cob as they’ve had before. our waitress was very friendly and gave us great service."
2022-06-04,MariaF,4.0,"good food, great service.  the grey sole was great."
2022-06-04,Knitbee,3.0,"not a good one. 6 people. 5 were served and 6th one sat with nothing. couldn’t find our waiter waitress came by and happened to notice missing meal so went to kitchen. meal came out cold. took long time to find waiter by which time others were more than half way they meal. waiter took plate back to be reheated. when it finally returned all that was there was the protein - none of the sides. several of the other meals were not hit (warm but not hit). when bill came( 3 checks had been requested), none were right!!!  in addition no compensation had been offered to the person whose meal was a disaster. after he asked for some  adjustment the waisted had to find a manager to approve which took a long time extremely disappointed. not sure we will return to this location."
2022-06-04,DaveW,2.0,food tasted more like a chain restaurant then a high quality restaurant.  clam chowder was still outstanding.
2022-06-03,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"disappointed, food used to be so much better, it was noisy , kids screaming and running around"
2022-06-03,Ballou,4.0,"we were glad the restaurant honored our two open table request- our favorite table and, most importantly, one of our favorite servers, trina. however, the management team needs to move on from the covid menu and return, at least in part, to the pre-pandemic offerings. the menu is more appropriate for a standard fare restaurant like 99 or olive garden, than the previous upscale offerings of pre-sale legal. the food quality is good, the variety is limited, and the prices are too high. we still remain patient fans. help us remember at least some of the old legal magic!"
2022-06-03,FunFoodies,4.0,"nice indoor space,  convenient on art 9, slow but pleasant service and pretty long wait for food (had a reservation) but seemed we were the anomaly. food was good, fairly priced. overall a reliable spot that we would return to."
2022-06-01,PeterH,5.0,the service was exceptional and food fantastic. our server could not have been more on top of things. absolutely great. a bit expensive but worth it.
2022-05-29,Debsreview,3.0,"i ordered the fisherman's platter. the coating on the fish is heavy and crunchy. i prefer a lighter batter, which i think is easier to digest. the menu is good and the service was excellent. for the price, i expect a little more of a light touch."
2022-05-28,Betty,4.0,the food is always excellent but the service was lacking.  although very nice our waiter disappeared on us a few times.
2022-05-28,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"food was great, service was horrible!"
2022-05-27,AverageGuy,5.0,"always great, high quality and a good value.  especially great for gluten-free dining, as all the fried options are gluten free (they use corn meal for their breading) and they keep excellent gluten free rolls available."
2022-05-22,NancyK,5.0,great food and service . the booths are very comfortable ways to cut mouse and viral transmission. staff attentive in unobtrusive ways.
2022-05-22,Greg,2.0,"go here for the clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, lobster and clam salad sandwiches.  thats it.  every time we try to eat something else it doesn't work.  our full meal took too long.  we just didn't get the attention of our server.  the meal probably took an extra 1/2 hour due to service.  very nice waiter.  he just never looked up to see if we needed something."
2022-05-22,Niki,5.0,"celebrated our daughter's graduation from college with the grandparents.  while there was initially some confusion about who was to be our server that delayed our table being greeted and offered drinks, the service we received after the server was identified was exquisite.

great food as always."
2022-05-22,MariS,4.0,"the test kitchen menu item,  gumbo was salt and the spices needed to be cooked more- raw smell and taste. 
the mexican corn cod needed some sauce. ambience and service was great."
2022-05-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great menu, great service"
2022-05-21,AllenAZ,5.0,always great seafood. excellent service as well. will definitely be back.
2022-05-20,DomenickD,5.0,wonderful anniversary!!!
2022-05-20,TripAdvisor,5.0,"you can always count on legal for an excellent meal and an enjoyable evening.  love it here, so we go often.  tonight we sat at the bar and loved our tuna tataki, fried shrimp, broccoli au gratin, cocktails and wine.  serge provided excellent service.

very highly recommended - ""hall of fame"""
2022-05-20,Peter,5.0,"we had an early reservation where the restaurant was just beginning to fill up. all the staff were there, food service was very quick and our server quincy was particularly attentive. enjoyed the experience and attention to detail. food - excellent flavor, seasoning and not overdone. calamari rhode island style was particularly noteworthy."
2022-05-18,AmyMan,2.0,waitress was just horrible. we felt like we were bothering her. she wasn't even available to process the check. not my experience at legals... but boy was she bad
2022-05-18,Rick,4.0,decor is a bit dated and the prices have skyrocketed but considering everything it’s still a place where you can get sustainable seafood at competitive pricing.
2022-05-14,LindaS,4.0,"everything was very fresh, prepared as stated!! we had the organic pei mussels, cod fritters , sesame crusted yellow fin tuna, simply grilled swordfish steak with broccoli au gratin,  herbed rice pilaf all cooked to order!! handled my crustacean allergy with no issue!!"
2022-05-14,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"not worth the money, go to you're local seafood retailer not this chai"
2022-05-14,AdamM,4.0,"appetizers were great; oysters and tuna poke. the meal not so much. rice was inedible, hard and dry. seafood was cooked well but didn’t have much flavor. unfortunate because this is usually a good restaurant."
2022-05-14,PauloFromMassachusetts,1.0,"we were celebrating my son's college graduation, so we decided to go to his favorite restaurant (pre-covid). we went early in the evening (4:30pm) so we could enjoy a quiet ambiance and an almost dedicated service. and that was our mistake!
arriving there at 4:30pm sharp (reserved time), the hostess didn't know where to sit our party (party of 6), and in an empty restaurant she decided to sit us at the kitchen entrance, where we could hear all the conversation and alarms in the kitchen. ok, i said, we are here to have fun, so i don't want to start creating a tough environment just because of that... well, that was not the worse... our waiter was the worst! apathetic, unresponsive, poor judgement... in an empty restaurant and at the legal's level, i expected to have to not wait to have his attention. he was always somewhere else and not near or around us.
the food was very good, but not great as it used to be (pre-covid). i ordered a cioppino (clams in a broth) where i got a couple of mussels with a bad taste! not acceptable in a restaurant at that level! one in out party didn't like seafood (!!!) and ordered their filet mignon. since he didn't like the suggested sides, we requested to replace them by only fries. well, to start, the steak was very small and didn't look  worth the $42 charged and the replacement we requested didn't happen. only a bit of fries was included instead of one of the sides. other than that, the rest of the food was very good.
the drinks (beers, margaritas, sparkling water) took forever to get to our table. the waiter blamed the bar to be busy, but the restaurant was empty, so that was unexpected.
the famous (pre-covid) ""pledge"" paper that they used to put on the table after the main meal and before the desert was gone! they don't pledge quality anymore? the desert menu was ridiculously small and famous options like bananas foster were not there anymore...
that was a pretty bad experience, and i don't see us going back to that legal anymore."
2022-05-13,EdwardG,5.0,"missed some old favorites like fish chowder, onion strings, polenta. prices are understandably up but the menu or special offerings could include some moderately priced smaller dishes. quality was excellent as was the service."
2022-05-12,RickV,5.0,do yourself a favor and eat here if you’re in the area. it’s priced a bit better than some places but for the quality and quantity i thought quite fair. food came fast and hot. staff and waiter were personable and professional. all in all a great experience!
2022-05-10,JayneG,1.0,"food was over cooked, service was slow. won’t go back"
2022-05-08,RobertG,4.0,"delicious meal once again at legal, this time for mother’s day. we all enjoyed our entrees: shrimp scampi, baked haddock and salmon. we also each had clam chowder and shared calamari. only suggestion would be to offer some kind of sauce for the plain calamari since it needs something like that. had to ask for and got tartare sauce. server had a few lapses but was very attentive and apologetic and given that it was a holiday perfectly understandable. will return. one of my favorites for seafood."
2022-05-08,Llllk,4.0,"it was mother's day, so it was a bit of a bummer that the food wasn't up to par.  cioppino had sand in it--husband said mussels tased old.  mom said the salmon wasn't as good as it usually is, the size was a little small, and it was not served with farro as usual--some kind of small round pasta?  my calamari appetizer tasted good, but the portion was small and the coating was coming off in a few pieces."
2022-05-08,TimmieP,3.0,food and service was not good for the amount of money we spent for our dinner meals.
2022-05-08,Ritak,5.0,always a constant - we were there for an easter meal as well.  excellent.
2022-05-08,PhilG,4.0,"good food,  great service even though it was busy on mother’s day and we were 15 minutes late for our reservation."
2022-05-07,LInda313,4.0,service was slow. waiter never came back to refill my ice tea. kept forgetting stuff

2022-05-07,MichelleP,5.0,"jeffrey,our waiter was amazing- friendly and professional. he made our evening special and the food was incredible had a gigantic lobster roll worth every penny!"
2022-05-07,Geoff,3.0,"arrived on the saturday before mother’s day, 1:15 reservation, main dining room is half full, clearing out... we are celebrating a 90th birthday and a party of four. 

the polish is rubbed off what was a successful family business. i had six 14-16 ct shrimp that were uninteresting at $3/each... then $38 for an underwhelming portion of chewy fried clams. the breading was right, the clams portion i found small and tough eating. not particularly juicy. mom had a 1.25# steamer lobster with two sides for $49... ouch! i thought the chinese market had abandoned usa product for the canadians, making lobster prices much lower. ok... 

not what it once was. and i used to visit the original inman sq market when there were communal tables and sawdust on the floor because you were seated inside a fish market... about 50 years ago. while we didn’t feel challenged to request any return to kitchen... it was mom’s birthday, so how wrong can a seafood restaurant mess up boiled lobster?!

caveat emptor"
2022-05-07,ScottW,3.0,service was poor. food not up to their usual high standards. a bit disappointing for a mother’s day celebration.
2022-05-06,TalinC,5.0,"we had a wonderful dinner/drinks and jeff, our waiter was amazing. it had been quite a while since we went to legals in framingham because we had a bad experience years ago and my husband didn't want to go again. we had a gift card so we figured we give it a try again. will definitely go back. we ordered some apps and my husband got oysters that were very fresh. he ordered the filet with grilled shrimp. the steak was cooked to perfection but he'll probably skip the shrimp next time not because it wasn't good, just too much food. i ordered the crab cakes for dinner and it was so good. can't wait to go back."
2022-05-01,Rick,2.0,"our waitress was superb. my wife and i chose this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. unfortunately a painfully loud family comprised of a screaming infant and two spoiled screaming toddlers were seated close to our table and ruined our dining experience. also, my ridiculously overpriced crab sandwich had numerous inedible hard pieces that the chef should have discovered while preparing it. every item on the menu is priced much too high. this restaurant used to be our favorite. it has become terrible, with the notable exception of our wonderful waitress."
2022-04-29,Matil,4.0,the hot lobster roll was awful! the lobster meat tasted terrible!
2022-04-24,TripAdvisor,5.0,"always a pleasure dining here.  tonight, crab cake, tuna tataki, blackened chicken, caesar w/blackened chicken, broccoli au gratin, street corn... all excellent.  drinks, wine perfect.  service from judy couldn't have been better!"
2022-04-23,JoshA,5.0,"been here a handful of times, staff is always professional and friendly. food is pricey but worth it as you really do get what you pay for here. legal's sets the bar for service as far as i'm concerned. highly recommend."
2022-04-22,Debi,3.0,i love legal and eat here often but tonight the experience was not good at all. appetizers were excellent but main course was not great at all. lobsters and shrimp were dry definitely over cooked.
2022-04-22,Ballou,5.0,trina made our visit special. she made sure my wife’s salmon was cooked to her liking. my sandwich and sides of rice and corn were delicious. the host made sure we had our favorite server and table. great friday afternoon visit to legal framingham!
2022-04-20,Unhappyguest,1.0,the waitstaff never brought our drinks and we had to ask the manager for them. then the diet coke for my rum and coke was flat. then the shrimp from the meal of my friend was tiny salted and hard. all in all not a great experience
2022-04-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always consistent
2022-04-17,FedB,3.0,"the food as always was superb. unfortunately, the terrible service provided marred the experience. we our server only came to the table twice, once to take our drink order and once to take our food order. we never saw him again. we had to ask a busperson for our check which eventually came... about 15 mins later. it's too bad that this was a shortcoming on what could have been an outstanding easter dining experience."
2022-04-17,Doug,4.0,"i ordered a meal from the test kitchen:  salmon

the arugula was a little too oily for my taste.  i asked our waiter to ask the chef to cook the salmon well.  the salmon came out pink in the middle and i wished that it had been cooked longer.  what ever the white sauce placed on top of the salmon was, there was not enough of the sauce  for me to taste the sauce."
2022-04-16,SanchesD,5.0,"we were there fo my wife’s birthday! the booking was easy and we were taken care of  right away. 
the food and service was great.

2022-04-15,Patricia,5.0,"yesterday was my first time i went to legal seafood of natick. i can believe it. everything was excellent.  great experience ever.

definitely my family and i are going to come back."
2022-04-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"very good as always. consistent. nice presentation of lobster mac & cheese in a lobster shell. 
only complaint is the booth we were seated. i asked for a table with chairs for this group of older ladies. then they offered a different booth which was a better set up but still not a table with chairs which were available."
2022-04-13,WendyD,3.0,always make sure to stop here for gluten free dining when i come home from out of state. i was disappointed this time with overall quality of my fish and chips.  the haddock was dark meat and piece was on the smaller piece.  my daughter had a salad with salmon.  the salmon had a thick blackened crust on the bottom.  she did order the cajun blackened option but it should bait taste burnt. and not edible.  will have to try again next visit and just hope it was a bad day.
2022-04-09,Sloane,4.0,overall it’s good food and but there were minor technical issues such as the sole being overcooked on the edges. service is great and it’s worth coming back to over and over.
2022-04-09,OpenTable Diner,2.0,service was terrible. it’s a shame always loved this location. many missteps through out the night. isle of sky was mediocre. disappointing. new ownership and standards appear to have slipped.
2022-04-09,LesleyLola,5.0,the food was great as always! this was our first time at this location. staff was very pleasant.
2022-04-08,LubahLikesFood,4.0,"service a little slow at first but got better

swordfish had great flavor but a bit over cooked 

$200 for 2  = fjb"
2022-04-06,Billino,5.0,"throughout the years, this place stays committed to excellence in food and service. i’ve never had a bad meal or service at this location. keep it up folks."
2022-04-03,wineluva12,5.0,"we love sitting in he bar area - nice sunlight and ambiance in the afternoon. 

food was great and our server was superb!"
2022-04-03,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we had a late reservation so was not expecting so many young children. a couple had 2 littles they were there prior to us and were still there after we had 3 courses. very cranky needless to say way past their bedtime. other than that which hopefully will be an episodic event the staff and food were outstanding.
2022-04-02,OpenStudio,3.0,unfortunately with the new ownership it's not ready for prime time.  there were items delivered in the wrong order- appetizer after meal.  dirty shrimp. items left out that had been ordered.  our food delivered to another table.  we felt sorry for the waiter.  it wasn't really his fault.  he told us that they were just getting up to speed after the ownership change.
2022-04-02,RitaK,5.0,birthday!!!
2022-04-01,OpenTable Diner,1.0,food was awful. we all got sick.
2022-04-01,meandhim,4.0,the food was wonderful the service was not so good. the waitress came over to the table as soon as our food was deviled by other staff and asked how everything was. i said we have not even had a bite yet. we never saw her again until she come over to ask if we wanted dessert.
2022-04-01,Ballou,4.0,"to bad our server was leaving legal to move to greece! alexander was outstanding!
our meals were good too! i had the new mexican cod and my wife had her favorite, crab salad roll.  the mexican cod with it's delicious corn side is not to be missed. the item came from the newly introduced menu and is a true winner. the cod was moist and fresh-just as we used to expect from legal. all in all, the experience was great. special thanks to trina who stopped by to say hello and recommend the cod!"
2022-03-31,KatieR,2.0,we arrived 5 minutes earlier than our reservation time and were seated.  waited almost 30 minutes for a waiter to come over and management never came over and apologized.
2022-03-30,LaPointeT,4.0,the restaurant is a solid choice if you are in the area
2022-03-30,SMMTDM,4.0,the greek salad ordered had kale and no appearance of anything greek

2022-03-27,jeffg,4.0,lots of great seafood choices - all of our meals were terrific

2022-03-24,DonnaJ,5.0,"judy was our server... expertise superior. manner and professionally delightful.  food was the trout. you do it great honor! you’re the only place we can get it prepared so lushishly. delish!  broccoli au gratin too large( though generous). perfect time to come. quiet, calming will be back soon.. for more trout!!."
2022-03-22,TripAdvisor,5.0,"i always thoroughly enjoy my meals here.  good, comfortable ambiance, excellent chow and libation, great service,  warm rolls, bang bang cauliflower, tuna takaki, crab cakes, fried shrimp, broccoli au gratin... all recommended.  

very highly recommended"
2022-03-20,CharlesM,2.0,"the reviews i read online were very mixed. i decided to give the place a try as i was craving seafood. our server was delightful and the ambiance was great. there was a good crowd so what could be bad, right? the food. i had a plate with their famous “lump” crabcake, scallops and shrimp with green beans. there was no lumps of crab but shredded pieces of crab and mostly bland mushy breading. it was not well flavored. the scallops  were rubbery and dry and the shrimp overcooked. the green beans looked old and shriveled. my dining partner fared better with the fried platter. the seafood looked and tasted fresh but there was an aftertaste that is usually indicative of frying in old oil. i’ve worked in restaurants before and know that sometimes happens. this is not what i expected at the prices charged."
2022-03-19,Susie,3.0,legal sea food is not as good as it used to be and is more expensive. the noise level is very disturbing and the food was just fair. i am not likely to return again anytime soon.

2022-03-18,Peachie,5.0,"had a great server, scott, very attentive & helpful. the runners were over the top polite & very attentive. the hosts were very friendly & knew their job. kitchen was busy but gave us time to talk at the table. a beautiful delicious dinner in under 2 hours. all in all it was awesome experience & i’ll be returning 😊"
2022-03-14,ChrisB,5.0,excellent food. great service. will definitely go back.
2022-03-12,barryg,3.0,the rolls were bland. my filet was over cooked and returned. the next filet was cooked fine but without flavor. the server was pleasant and responsive. my wife's food was decent. it was an ok meal but way overpriced.
2022-03-11,TonyM,5.0,"good meal, great service.  just wish they’d go back to the wine flights as that was always our favorite th8mg, sampling the wines to then choose what was best.   also the appetizer menu could use a cooked shrimp app as not much there that we prefer. so while the  menu has clearly been reduced, the food and service is still good"
2022-03-11,Millers,5.0,bar service is always amazing here.   food was delicious.  thank you
2022-03-11,GaryR,5.0,"great food, great service every time we go.  a bit pricey but excellent"
2022-03-05,TaylorG,5.0,"i love the test kitchen menu! while everything else on the menu sounds great, those test kitchen options always end up being my choice. the variety of sides here is also awesome!"
2022-03-05,Jennifer,5.0,"jeff was our waiter! he was amazing friendly , outgoing and couldn’t have asked for better!"
2022-03-02,StatLady,5.0,excellent!
2022-03-02,Irish26,5.0,great service and food. pace of meal and server recommendations were great. did not feel rushed at all.  drinks refilled promptly.
2022-02-28,Cort,4.0,our waiter was awesome and the food was good.it could’ve been seasoned a lot better.i don’t think the food is better than food at at your regular local seafood joint.it was nice for a birthday dinner
2022-02-27,KarenG,5.0,"excellent lunch.  great and friendly service, and our food was very good."
2022-02-26,OpenTable Diner,5.0,birthday visit
2022-02-26,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is still going strong.  love the consistent, excellently prepared chow, fine service and good libation.  tonight the tuna tataki, bang bang cauliflower, and the fried shrimp, both excellent.  

highly recommended"
2022-02-24,GlennO,4.0,"i think its time for legal to update the decor, seems a bit drab and 90's"
2022-02-23,marjo,4.0,"we eat here many times and usually we are very happy with our meals, but sometimes, things don't go right all the time. i order oysters rockefeller many times and they are usually very good, but not only has the order gone from 6 oysters to 4, for the same price, they have been overdone the past few times i ordered them. in addition, on this visit, the trout was also overcooked. but the rest of our 4 meals were good. 
and we still cant understand how the largest sea food restaurant in boston area still does not serve octopus!"
2022-02-23,Alejandro,5.0,"great food and drinks as always 
the tuna tataki, fish and chips and half chicken were amazing.
our server natalia was very nice and provided excellent service.
we’ll be back soon!"
2022-02-23,Ballou,5.0,"once again we enjoyed service from trina. she made extra sure our food would be perfect-especially after she heard about our last visit. that visit was so disappointing that we almost didn’t come back. however, we thought judy would be working and our experience is always great with her. she was on vacation, hence trina. we were happy to have her. our food was perfect. my wife’s salmon was perfectly prepared to her liking. i had the crab salad roll with a nicely toasted bun. all of the sides were hot and tasty! our desert, bobbons, were at a perfect temperature-not frozen solid like the last visit. our faith in legal framingham was restored thanks to trina!"
2022-02-23,ShorelineSue,5.0,"the fish was fresh, as always.  food was delicious, service excellent."
2022-02-20,BruinsRule,3.0,food quality was average at best and prices were high for what you got. perplexed on how a seafood restaurant runs out of swordfish and how i'm not told until entrees are coming to the table for the rest of the party. management did make good on that error. there are just too many seafood options in the area to be trying to get by on name alone.
2022-02-20,BML7,4.0,the colossal stuffed shrimp was great with real crab meat stuffing. the flounder and salmon were great as well. the lobster bisque and the crab cake were also very delicious. the spiced apple punch and the hibiscus were good cocktails. they were very busy and the waiter forgot our bread but the food was worth the wait.
2022-02-20,kevinH,3.0,"wait for ever to be served..did not get my starters before entrees came out ..could not get another drink with my dinner as server never came to see us ...got free dessert..but really did not make up for the evening  .will not be in any hurry back
overpriced for sure"
2022-02-19,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"wrong order delivered. 
fish was very fishy tasting 
charged credit card three times."
2022-02-18,JohnH,5.0,"we generally always have a good meal at legal seafoods. the service is excellent. they don't rush the food to you so you feel pressured to eat and run. the tables are spread our enough and the booths separated by tasteful barricades, making the experience better for the covid-weary."
2022-02-14,CityAtNight,3.0,unfortunately the seafood at legal is no longer as fresh as it used to be.
2022-02-14,JeffZ,4.0,valentines day meal with my lovely. food was good as usual. drinks were strong as usual.  never had a bad meal here.
2022-02-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent food and service. legal seafood is consistently excellent. we come here often and we are never disappointed. their seafood is always fresh and perfectly prepared. the staff all wear masks and that makes us feel safer.
2022-02-13,KerryD,4.0,good food. for sure. service was not great. we were served mussels with no spoon or fork to get them on to our dish. my husbands bourbon was full of ice. it’s like they didn’t know how to make an old fashion.
2022-02-12,JaniceB,4.0,great for families and those with food allergies.  great service
2022-02-12,out2dine,4.0,we had a very enjoyable dinner at legal seafood. the clam chowder was delicious and had lots of clams. grilled swordfish was perfect and the lemon butter side option added a nice flavor. grilled yellow fin tuna was also delicious and au gratin broccoli side and rice pilaf were very good. our waitress gave us great service and the open table reservation got us in quickly and gave us a very nice table. it’s always well worth the visit.
2022-02-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,fish was great we had the sole salmon and mahi mahi
2022-02-11,GraceC,5.0,legal is quality! my husband and i know we won’t be disappointed.
2022-02-11,Judy,5.0,food was delicious and the waiter (jeff) was excellent!!
2022-02-11,Ballou,3.0,"it wasn’t our server, quincy, fault. he gave us the best service he could. it was the food. the kitchen should have never let him serve what he delivered. we both ordered grilled shrimp, herb and jasmine rice, and broccoli. all of the items arrived cold. the shrimp was  “rubbery “, the rice was cold, and the “steamed soft” broccoli was anything but. to top it off, our usually favorite bonbons were so frozen, we could barely eat them. only tasty items were the rolls-served hot and soft. we come here often-usually in mid afternoon. no excuse for this experience. kitchen, take note. the quality needs to improve if you expect customers to return and spend $70 plus tip. very disappointed."
2022-02-11,TunaFishy,5.0,the pistachio-crusted salmon with kale and farro was amazing. all four people at our table cleaned their plates!
2022-02-09,Millers,5.0,had lunch at the bar today and as usual was perfect.  bartender always is spot on and a gentleman.  great food and always consistent.  bring back oysters legal and remove the oysters rockefeller. please
2022-02-06,JohnE,4.0,"every time we come here we always say “that was really good” followed by “it’s too bad it’s so expensive, we’d otherwise come more.”
my wife had oysters, followed by the mussels. she raved about the mussels saying they were as good as ones she had in brussels a few years back which she always talks about. i had the grilled scallops with cajun seasoning. while they were very good, i only got 7 small sized scallops. not as small as bay scallops but, not anywhere near the size they should have been. and for $26..."
2022-01-28,Ballou,5.0,"trina did an excellent job serving us. very attentive! crab rolls with rice and broccoli. great legal chowder for starters. i’ve cream bonbons for desert. 
great to see sergi!"
2022-01-27,MegM,5.0,great baked haddock meal!  great service!  delicious maple bread pudding for dessert.
2022-01-27,Fred,2.0,"legal has changed the menu and taken certain items that were good off.  their prices do not warrant what they provide to you in the form of food nor its quality.
 the service was impeccable. the people that work there are over the top friendly cordial and you'd want to come back just for that."
2022-01-24,WayneS,3.0,"hadn't been for a while. not the ls i remember. grilled mahi too salty, sides not great."
2022-01-23,JeanS,5.0,the food was delicious as always . service was also very good
2022-01-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"our server was amaaaazing! the young guy with a beard, i don’t remember the name unfortunately. the food was good. we got oysters, fish tacos and shrimp scampi. everything was delicious, but not sure about shrimp scampi. was not so delicious to me personally. 
we spent a great time there."
2022-01-20,BernardoB,5.0,"the staff was very friendly and courteous.  i was lucky enough to have michael as my waiter and he exceeded my expectations at every turn.  pouring my champagne and bringing the food promptly at the right time.
the food was superb.  it had been a long long time since i had such a mouthful of tasty jumbo shrimps.  the were off the charts.
the lobster bisque was decadent and the steamed lobster was an absolute delight.  the jazmin rice and farro salad complemented it wonderfuly.
at the end, the price i paid does not really cover the magnificent experience of that particular dinner."
2022-01-16,OpenTable Diner,3.0,went there for my nieces 25 birthday the issue was the food was very bland. i have been legals seafood more times than i can count and this is the first time i have experienced bland food. emmy whole party had the same experience with the food.
2022-01-16,ElizabethV,4.0,"food was delicious. waitress brought me the breaded haddock instead of grilled.  it was delicious but would have preferred grilled.  she also forgot to bring an espresso and coffee so we reminded her when she brought the bill. overall, we love legal seafood."
2022-01-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent customer service and the food was delicious. well prepared and temperature was just right. thank you
2022-01-15,Cindy,5.0,chowder day so $1 cups of chowder on top of great food and service made it perfect day at legal seafood!
2022-01-15,Peetie,1.0,"the fried clams were immediately returned - chewy and overcooked. they were swiftly replaced, no complaints about the service. however, they were over seasoned and not nearly as good as many other places. the fish and chip were only average for the area. the cooking has declined.
we took home the clam chowder (reduced price the day we visited). unfortunately, it turned out to be gritty.
we are not returning to legal sea food."
2022-01-15,James,5.0,legals has always been very consistent for us.  some of the best appetizers around
2022-01-14,frankie,5.0,fish is always fresh and well prepared! our wait staff was delightful and attentive.
2022-01-14,MarkW,5.0,"food superb, waiter jeffrey and bartender (forgot his name, but from croatia) beyond outstanding. a wonderful date night for me and my wife."
2022-01-12,Ballou,5.0,came hungry straight from the doctors! glad we stopped at legal. double glad we asked for judy! great serve and food as usual. grilled salmon and crispy fish sandwich were our choices. started with legal’s world famous chowder. ended with a delicious slice of pumpkin cheesecake! nice quiet table with plenty of “covid” space. can’t beat legal in framingham!
2022-01-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always high quality food & service- love this location.
2022-01-09,MaryM,5.0,"mom’s birthday- 

there were bones in the baked haddock, but our server fixed the situation right away. overall great experience, our server was wonderful."

2021-12-31,Truthful,5.0,"nye dinner with family.  legal never disappoints. the food is always good and the service is consistently good.  

we were concerned with covid but we were presented with a large booth, far enough from other diners."
2021-12-31,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food was very good ! jeff, our waiter was there from another location and was excellent !!"
2021-12-30,RajibC,5.0,great food and awesome host. would recommend without no doubt.
2021-12-29,JohnG,1.0,this is not the legal seafoods from the past . since it was sold i say stay away!
2021-12-28,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"i was so disappointed. this isn’t my first time at legal and usually it’s great, especially for someone with gluten allergies. 
we walked in, got our drinks, and when we went to order they were out of gluten free bread, calamari, and steak tips. at the end we weren’t offered dessert or another drink. 
our waitress barely came over to us. it took 20 minutes of get our check and then another 20 for her to run my credit card. 
not a very pleasurable experience this time."
2021-12-28,Gailm,3.0,lunch is overpriced and not always good.  scallops tasted bitter and bread stale.   lobster macaroni and cheese however was great.
2021-12-26,Izzy,4.0,"foods great, customer service is quick and efficient"
2021-12-26,cards135,5.0,we hadn't been since june 2021 and we had a wonderful experience on december 2021.  the waiter and staff were all very attentive.  also glad to see that they have sole back on the menu!
2021-12-25,Frenchy,5.0,"holiday night, restaurant not full so service was excellent and noise level low. excellent food"
2021-12-24,JaredK,4.0,went on christmas eve for an early dinner. place wasn't packed at all. food came out hot and fresh. server was very attentive. defiantly recommend this location.
2021-12-24,PaulC,2.0,"well, you asked. are you sure you want to hear this?

   while the overall experience was ok, but wasn't comeasurant with the cost, i feel i can only express my visit as somewhat of a letdown. the last time we dined with you i said to myself, the heck with the long drive and the pricy menu, the experience will be well worth it, i confess was some time ago, maybe a few plus years. 
  with that said, let me describe that previous visit. we ordered two 2lb baked stuffed lobsters, because we've had them before and you made them the best by far. the wait staff bought them out and they looked so fabulous that they should have had armed guards as everybody eyed them as they passed by. the stuffing was piled  with more seafood bulging from the inside begging to be eaten. everthing was perfect. 
   skipping to the end of the meal, you served us some black tea that was so fantastic that we had to ask where iff came from.  you staff promptly wrote down the source of this delightful beverage. it was served with  a fancy steaming tea pot and a tea infusers loaded with fresh tea leaves brewing right in front of us. delightful.  complemented with a fantasticly presented dessert. it was the most memorable evening well worth cost to which i never even remembered how much it cost. 
i didn't care! 
   now last night's description of the evening wasn't quite t he same. we had asked for nice spot in a booth somewhere and with plenty available got put in the corner next to the back side entrance to the restrooms, with the brooms and what i asumed was little kids high chairs staked up. no big deal, we got up and moved closer to the center of the room and informed the waitress, no big deal. all was fine again. 
  we ordered the oysters rockefeller and the mussels for and appetizers and while they we're ok, we were expecting something always a step up from the legal seafood kitchen. they were quite ordinary, or even just plain like you would get from much lesser establishments. (cont)"
2021-12-23,OpenTable Diner,1.0,the scallops are too small. the place is just dated. it hasn’t changed since it opened. scrimping. no longer a fish place but a nouveau cuisine establishment with sharks hanging from the ceiling.
2021-12-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,fantastic!
2021-12-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,still the best clam chowder and fried clams.
2021-12-21,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the menu has changed and is too limited. no steamers or other old favorites.
2021-12-21,BernadetteC,5.0,"always a great dining experience- food was great and service was excellent 
thanks"
2021-12-20,CaitP,4.0,"food was great! service was slow at first, but was much better as the meal progressed! food was delicious, but expensive."

birthday treat was a special surprise!! loved every minute!"
2021-12-18,TripAdvisor,5.0,"always a treat coming here for dinner.  excellent cocktails to start, the tuna tataki, followed by fried shrimp w fries and broccoli.  great service.  love it!!"
2021-12-17,JonB,4.0,"legal is still legal: good service and excellent food in a big room with reasonable, but high, prices.
we went with another couple for a friday night dinner. the host staff and the service staff were all wearing masks, but of course, no patrons were. it felt like a risk.
we were served quickly, drinks were large and well made and the food was great, especially the scallops. sides were also good - the sichuan string beans were particularly appreciated.
no room for dessert.
we'll probably wait a while before coming back. even a great dinner isn't worth getting sick..."
2021-12-17,Charles,5.0,the food is always hot and delicious.  the staff is friendly and service is quick.
2021-12-17,Ballou,5.0,"great meal and service! my only suggestion is to provide better instructions to the food runner who delivered our bonbons. you really need a fork and knife to open these little frozen treats. the chocolate sauce is a nice visual touch, but it’s like handling a greased bowling ball. save the sauce for your regular ice cream deserts."
2021-12-16,RobinView,5.0,"i am a celiac, and legal sea foods is consistently the only place i can eat and feel fantastic after i leave. as a result, i eat there a lot!  the food is always perfect!  i did run into an issue on my last visit, however.  i made sure to let the waitress know that my gluten issue is an allergy. i ordered the fried clams. when they were put in front of me by a server, and there was no gf flag on them.

i immediately called the waitress over and explained that the manager usually brings me my gf meal. her reply: “oh yeah! i could get in trouble for not doing that, but i can tell you that your meal is 100% gluten free. i’ll go back to the kitchen and confirm.”  she left, she came back, she confirm!

i enjoyed my perfect meal, drove home ... and was sick in the bathroom for the next three hours. a wheat/gluten allergy had very specific, unmistakable symptoms. i had all of them.

i used to trust this restaurant implicitly. i don’t any longer, and i’ve definitely learned a lesson about that. if the manger didn’t walk it over, don’t eat it!!"
2021-12-16,STEPHENM,5.0,"waiter jeffrey was outstanding 
very personable and educated us on the restaurant and company 
also very attentive and anticipated all our needs"
2021-12-15,chefoz,4.0,legal is so reliable for excellent service and top-notch sea food. we went for a lunch and it was an excellent meal.
2021-12-12,Fifi,5.0,waiter was awesome !
2021-12-12,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"i’ve been to this establishment many times and i hate to say it but seems to be slipping. i’ve never had bad service in my life at this restaurant but it was very bad. it was almost like i was putting my server out by wanting to order an appetizer and then had to ask several times to order our entrees. he couldn’t get away from the table quick enough and had zero customer service skills. the food was tasty as usual so that was a positive.  as i sat there, i started to notice the dated decor and realized the place does need a facelift. the icing on the cake was my trip to the bathroom on my way out. there was toilet paper everywhere and only 330 pm (not right before closing).  it was truly disgusting."
2021-12-11,JohnG,2.0,"this restaurant was once the place to go for special occasions. 
has gone way downhill !"
2021-12-11,pacmangolf,5.0,"stopped in for dinner before heading off to a concert. trina, our server for the night was pleasant and answered any question we had for her. 
we started off with drinks and calamari ri style. they came out piping hot were crispy flavorful and the “sauce” on the bottom had just the right amount of kick. 
main courses were mixed seafood combo (crab cake, shrimp and sea scallops that were grilled to perfection). they were served with rice pilaf and mixed greens.  the other meal was fried whole belly clams that were so sweet and tender they were to die for. bothe dinner sizes were huge and at $39 and $36respectively were a very good value in this day and age. great meal thanks."
2021-12-11,markm,5.0,"the food was amazing. 
impeccably prepared. 
our waitress was outstanding.  attentive, friendly,  helpful and always there when we needed her"
2021-12-10,CarolG,5.0,haven’t been in a long time....just as i remembered...delish!
2021-12-09,GR8place,4.0,"after shuffling between tables to accommodate the reservation of 6 (they tried to squeeze us into a tiny booth in the bar area meant for 4 smaller people) we were seated and the meal was excellent.  the greeter could use some tuning up on hospitality skills.

the manager checked in several times and had a good sense of humor.  weird that all 6 of us had the haddock dinner which was stellar!"
2021-12-05,Louise,4.0,"always a sure value at every level: food ,wine and atmosphere. nice and friendly staff and they have this wonderful alsatian wine trimbach (riesling or pinot gris) that never disappoints and works well with most of their dishes. we always drop in when in the neighborhood."
2021-12-03,JanetM,5.0,food and service is outstanding!    well run and managed - we eat here regularly when visiting from seattle.  oysters followed by fried clams are my favorite (although everything is good.)
2021-11-28,RonB,4.0,good service. very quiet for a sunday afternoon. it is our family’s go to restaurant. however the one negative is that prices have definitely spiked up and the menu selection has definitely been impacted by covid.
2021-11-28,CarolinaS,5.0,legal seafoods is one of my favorite seafood restaurants. the starters and appetizers are amazing. the cocktails are also very good! the servers are super nice and the ambience is also very cozy. love going there !
2021-11-28,JohnA,3.0,one dinner was dry and over cooked. thought the other dishes had very little taste. very disappointed
2021-11-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another fantastic meal at legal. sat at the bar. really loved the cape scallops, featured as a special. liked that they were prepared simply and baked, to let the flavors sing. shrimp cocktail and tuna tataki, always excellent. roast potatoes and the broccoli au gratin, so good! some cocktails and a glass of sonoma cutrer enhanced our meal.

autumn and serge provided fantastic service. a great evening!

very highly recommended"

2021-11-20,ClaudetteM,4.0,"our former favorite restaurant is much improved over the past few months.  we went there six months ago after being vaccinated and where quite underwhelmed.  however; the menu has added some dishes, brought back one of my favorites and the atmosphere is very nice.  we were pleased."

receptionist was nice.  
server was good.  
drinks were good.  
same old decor.  
lots of our favorites taken off the menu. 
scallops were tiny.  portion size was tiny for $33-
drinks were expensive.  
3 people for $235- is expensive for just a quick dinner bite out."
2021-11-17,Ballou,5.0,"great as always. salmon, rice, and cole slaw followed by pumpkin cheese cake! hmmm. judy was great as always!"
2021-11-16,carolL,5.0,waitress was excellent...attentive and knowledgeable about menu selections
2021-11-15,Bottomline222,4.0,the bay scallops were excellent. the choice of sides awful. green beans and broccoli are my two least favorite vegetables and that’s all they have. bring back spinach or asparagus and the polenta.
2021-11-14,GordonZ,1.0,"i just had the worst dining experience thanks to the african american manager here.
the course my wife ordered is cooked with  red wine (not shown in ingredients) which is supposed to be completely cooked out. my wife is allergic to alcohol. and her face turned hot red and felt dizzy right after eating it. we immediately let the waiter know when the dish was barely touched. besides the dish is super bitter. we ordered it as a takeout many times in the past so we have a good idea how it should taste like. so he took the dish back for a redo.

however, in less than one minute the manager came with the dish, asking us with a very impatient and even insulting tone what we want from this. this dish was cooked just as it should be. i said no. you can taste it yourself.

then he took the dish back to the kitchen. as i went to the kitchen hoping to explain to him more clearly, i heard him ranting about how we are unreasonable. i went up and asked him what he meant by that and why he would blame us for their fault. as other diners looking at him, he turned soft and said he would take it off our check.

and he never came over to our table to say sorry before we leave. this type of service is purely horrible. i would surely never dine here again."
2021-11-13,Loumar,4.0,"martha vineyard scallops were delish in a baked crumb sauce, for 48 dollars it better be good. the rice side and broccoli were boring.   never got our bread.  pumpkin cheese cake was yummy."
2021-11-13,GeorgeA,3.0,"can’t say legal’s is living up to its reputation lately.  core waiter was ok but random food bringers spilled beverages and dumped forks on me and the floor.  bisque was cold.  entrees were ok, broccoli undercooked and pilaf soupy.  choc. cake was dry.  gonna take a legal’s break for a while."

2021-11-11,JoyA,4.0,"server was very polite but he got my order wrong. i had asked for some of the sides to be omitted and replaced with a salad but the dish came as is. it was not a big deal. i had to wipe the mayonnaise sauce off since i don’t like it. 

al on all it was a nice lunch."
2021-11-11,Ballou,5.0,"another great lunch. a little bit different this time. grilled salmon, fries, coleslaw & crispy fish sandwich with same. pumpkin cheesecake for desert! (get it while it’s available!). judy’s service was impeccable-always. this location is really making an effort to regain the old legal excellence! try it!"
2021-11-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"although it's under new management, legal is just as good as before, both in terms of quality of food and service!"
2021-11-05,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"terrible service
waited 15 min for the wrong drinks, poor resolution, new drinks never came after 20 more min i left.  good order was taken, shaun 20 min later not even the chowder came.
server did not communicate at any time other than to take food order, deliver wrong drinks"
2021-11-05,jonathang,5.0,sat at the bar which we hardly ever do at legals. the food was terrific and we could customize our martinis. perfect date night. our bar person was awesome!
2021-11-05,LoriB,5.0,friend’s birthday
2021-11-04,OpenTable Diner,4.0,love this spot! always lovely to come here for celebrations
2021-11-02,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"date night- first time eating indoors since beginning of pandemic. they took every precaution to make us feel safe, loved the plexiglass division!!!"
2021-11-02,Ballou,5.0,michael did an excellent job. (in the same league as judy!) our food was served hot and fresh. our experience was just what we needed after a very busy day. legal is back!
2021-11-01,EllenlC,4.0,the music being played was loud and annoying.  my friend wears a hearing aid and difficulty do to the interference caused by the music. i requested that it be turned down.
2021-10-31,Noneofyourbusiness,2.0,slow service. cold food. we could have stayed home and had a better meal. will not return.
2021-10-31,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had a good time and food was pretty good.
2021-10-29,JessN,5.0,"we arrived a little early for our reservation but were seated very quickly, the food and drinks were delicious, our waiters were super attentive and kind. it made for a great date night!"
2021-10-25,Cynthia,5.0,"frequent customers of this legal seafood, and have certain things we seem to order regularly, until yesterday!
we shared the mussels- terrific and a new must have....then the 12” long crabmeat roll! it was the best, crab, mayo salt & pepper.... it was beyond wonderful...no lettuce, takes up too much room!

it was the first time in ages that every bite and sip of my lunch was perfect!

congratulations legal, another delightful experience!"
2021-10-23,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"food was good, drinks were delicious. however when ordering a bowl of lobster bisque, more good pieces of lobster. bang bang cauliflower wasn’t as good. too much chili sauce."
2021-10-22,Ballou,2.0,"unfortunately, this visit was disappointing. the food quality was poor. i had grilled shrimp, roasted potatoes, and coleslaw. my wife had bay scallops, roasted potatoes, and coleslaw. we both had bonbons for desert. my shrimp were over cooked, the roasted potatoes were odd chunks of peeled whole potatoes that lacked any taste, and the coleslaw, which came in a “shot glass “ sized container were bland. the wife complained the same adding the “bay scallops “ were very small. the bonbons were frozen solid making them difficult to eat. our server was definitely off her game even though the restaurant was not busy(4:30pm). the meal with tip came to $100- a lot  of what we received. 
we have been big fans of this location for a long time, but we definitely noticed quality reduction. hopefully, this will be a “one off” experience as we will try again."
2021-10-21,Disappointed,3.0,legal used to be great but now i think it’s time has gone. i ordered fried clams. they were overcooked and honestly based on the burnt flecks i think the oil they used was old. coleslaw was bad. i’ve been to several other restaurants  in the last month and ordered fried clams and each was better.  i think legal is resting on it’s laurels.
2021-10-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great service. ate in the bar so noise was expected. great bowl of chowder.
2021-10-20,Micky,5.0,we tried some new items and were very pleased.  the crab cake trio and the stuffies were excellent.
2021-10-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"service and food are great,   but the menu changes a little, my favorite dishes is no long served. otherwise, it still my favorite restaurant."
2021-10-13,Ballou,5.0,taylor was an outstanding server! one of best! in the same league as judy! food was great- two crab salad rolls with fries and cole slaw! quiet table. excellent covid precautions!  bon-bons for desert-yum!
2021-10-08,Judith,3.0,our orders were overcooked but still tasty. the staff were very helpful to get the heaters working since we were eating outside.
2021-10-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,kind and attentive service.
2021-10-07,Teammarina,3.0,legals needs to up their game to stay current. my friend's fish was buried in bread crumbs. he barely ate a thing and is a big eater. the menu is overpriced and underwhelming in quality. this was my last visit.
2021-10-07,Terry,5.0,"ate outside on a nice fall evening. i still don’t like eating inside with covid, so this was a great option. our waitress was awesome and food arrived promptly. first time back since the restaurant changed hands. i was pleased that the clam chowder is still awesome. we were disappointed that trout is off the menu, but understand changes were needed to compete during covid. salmon and cod were both excellent and the broccoli au gratin was huge and delicious. 7 layer chocolate cake was yummy."
2021-10-04,HappyinColorado,5.0,excellent service. our favorite massachusetts dining.
2021-10-04,Carol,2.0,"i have been a customer for over 40 years at legal.  dining in on monday for lunch, i found the food tasteless and cold.  additionally, the clam chowder is not like the days of old.  it is highly unlikely i will be a return diner as i feel the standard has totally diminished. sad, but true."
2021-10-03,Janet,5.0,"delicious food and outstanding service. prices higher each year, and getting to the point of too high for everyday dining. will save for special occasions only."
2021-10-03,LoisM,5.0,you can always count on legals!  great seafood and many gluten free dishes on the menu.  we had a member of our party who has celiac.  he was able to order fried calamari.  we all enjoyed them.  very light.  seafood is fresh.  service was quick.
2021-09-23,CarolO,3.0,"food was disappointing. scallops were flavorless and sides were bland (roasted potatoes, broccoli gratin)."
2021-09-19,DeRH,5.0,we were celebrating a special birthday and were able to sit outside on a beautiful evening! everything was terrific!
2021-09-19,OpenStudio,4.0,"we had lunch in the bar room with friends.  the food was very good, as expected.  the service was excellent."
2021-09-18,SteveS,2.0,"the food was great but the service was terrible...our server forgot many things or got things wrong and never apologized ...every other time i have got to legal's, the service is exceptional. this server needs to be trained!!"
2021-09-17,DavidC,3.0,"legals has gone done hill with the effects of covid and the new ownership making changes.  smaller menu, new staff, less quality.  still good but used to be great."
2021-09-17,Ballou,5.0,carissa was a wonderful server! we enjoyed an early dinner with delicious crab meat sandwiches and boston cream pie! the restaurant is very clean and does an excellent job managing covid requirements.
2021-09-17,Cynthia,5.0,"legal has the best fish and outstanding chips!

a mid afternoon lunch found the restaurant at least half full!

would love to see some additions to your more limited covid menu, or weekend specials!
stuffies still priced real high, love them but i can say no at that rate"
2021-09-16,Sandypo,4.0,"last night's dinner at legal was very good -- as always. shrimp scampi was terrific, so were the mussels and chowder. my husband asked for pan seared scallops and was very pleased with the result. when our server found out it was my husband's birthday she comped our dessert!

on our way out we had a great chat with the managers, one of whom had come to our table to compliment my hsuband on his taste in clothes because they both owned the same shirt!"
2021-09-16,WabanJane,5.0,first time returning to legal's since new management.  happy to report we found it mostly the same!  my friend has a good sensitivity and they took great care in her food order.  good service and friendly.  we ate outside at the tables set up along the side of the building.  i would return and recommend!
2021-09-15,AdrianaP,5.0,food was excellent and service was above and beyond.  great place for good seafood.
2021-09-11,joel67,4.0,"service was somewhat slow and there were errors on our orders.  i think that it was more the kitchen rather than our water who appeared to have too many tables to wait on.  food was good.

i was disappointed that my long-term favorites were no longer on the menu - blue fish and shandong sauce.

i am not rushing back."
2021-09-11,GreggS,3.0,"very used to pre sale legal seafood.   service was horrendess while tables around us seemed to be serviced. brought appetizers and main dishes at same time.  never checked on us during the meal or even after to see if we wanted desert or our check.  menu was very limited compared to old legals.  price of average meal was through the roof.  after legals being a mainstay of our restaurant experiences prior to the sale of the company, we are never going back.  it is too bad."
2021-09-09,Manger,5.0,the tuna with thai vegetables could have been spicier and had more flavor. good but disappointing.
2021-09-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,service great and food great.
2021-09-08,Bostoncouple1,3.0,"so disappointed 
legal sea food but no oysters available at all said our waiter?!"
2021-08-28,ColeenC,5.0,"the meal (char grilled salmon, baked potatoes and asparagus) was just right...it was hot and flavorful. i enjoyed every bite. our server was welcoming and attentive."
2021-08-27,OpenTable Diner,1.0,legal seafoods has been sold to a new corporation. the quality of the food the ambulance and service how decline to the point that we no longer plan to visit. find it very sad because it used to be my go to for all things seafood.
2021-08-27,TexasAMFan,5.0,another great experience at legal seafood. service was beyond excellent. food was out of this world.
2021-08-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,jeff was great and it was a great birthday for my mom.
2021-08-27,RobinView,5.0,"this was my first time back in a few years, and it was so worth the wait! sadly, i never seem to catch any of the legal seafoods when they are stocked with gluten-free rolls. today was no exception.  however, legal is quite literally the only place i can get gf fried clams and french fries.  they did not disappoint! the oysters were perfection."
2021-08-27,ChowderHead,3.0,"for 30 years, legal's has been my favorite go-to restaurant for lunch with business colleagues, and a great place to have dinner with family and friends.  this was the first time i've been to legal's since the chain was sold.  i ordered my old standby for lunch -- a tuna burger, which i have had countless times.  well, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't special either.  and, and $18, it wasn't a good value.  all the items on the menu had higher prices, which shouldn't be a total surprise, given the difficulties that everyone is having with vendors. i was surprised at how empty the restaurant was for a friday lunch crowd.  the bar looked half full at best.  we had a low-top in the bar area and cold see into main dining room, which looked almost empty.  i won't end my long-term relationship with legal's just yet.  i want to see the new legal's succeed, but my experience on this visit just wasn't up to par."
2021-08-26,MaureenB,5.0,worth the trip...food quality is great and the service is outstanding.
2021-08-25,ricks,5.0,"the food was great, as always. the service was good. we ate indoors, at an early hour, and the dining room was not crowded. i appreciated that the service people wore masks."
2021-08-24,MillerTime,3.0,prices continue to increase. menu limited offerings.
2021-08-23,SeanF,4.0,"we arrived early and we’re not allowed to sit our table til the designated reservation time. our waitress was very attentive and took care of us the entire time.
we were a little disappointed with fish tacos appetizer as the corn tortillas fell apart after a few bites. we were also given the wrong side for one of our meals but overall the quality of the meals was very good."
2021-08-23,AnthonyB,5.0,"always consistent - always good! don't thing ive ever had a bad meal at any legal sea food location. its our ""go to"" whenever we are craving fish and our ""lets keep it simple"" if we just want a chowder and salad before or after a movie. it can be fancy- it can be casual- all wrapped up into one!"
2021-08-21,John,5.0,no problems. great food and service.
2021-08-20,Mitch,5.0,"second time we have been since the berkowitz family sold it. first time was so so. this time the food was superb. we had shrimp, scallops and crab cakes and all were excellent. will definitely go back."
2021-08-20,out2dine,4.0,"legal seafoods continues to offer top quality, delicious seafood. we enjoyed a wonderful meal and our server gave us great service. their clam chowder is excellent. crab cake combo and cioppino were delicious meals. with our open table reservation, we got right in."
2021-08-18,TaraH,5.0,i have been to legal sea foods - framingham numerous times over the past few years.  this latest experience was the best yet.  the food was the best i've had there and the service was great.  i will now be going on a more frequent basis.
2021-08-18,LissyW,5.0,service was great. couldn’t really hear the music. only in the restrooms area. food was good.
2021-08-18,Iluv2travel,4.0,legal seafoods is a personal favorite. however it is expensive
2021-08-17,RandiJ,5.0,still the best fish restaurant around.
2021-08-17,GaryS,5.0,"legal always has outstanding food and the service was terrific . we sat outside and it could use some sprucing up with plants or sidewalk screenings to add some ambiance.
i was disappointed somewhat with the reduced beer selection however it was more than mad up by the outstanding and super fresh oysters.
my ahi tuna was perfect and just the right taste of spice and heat."
2021-08-15,KBarry,3.0,"the food was good. would love to have a fresh cold salad and coleslaw but it came worm with my meal

for $200. i expected the food to be prepared a bit better and the women’s bathroom looked like i was in walmart. wait. walmart’s bathroom was cleaner.  it was disgusting. i mentioned that to the host and he could not have cared less

lobster was great, and crab cake was excellent"
2021-08-14,CarolD,5.0,the clam chowder was delicious.  we shared it as an appetizer.  i ordered a test kitchen grilled tuna with thai vegetables.  the tuna was very good but the thai vegetables were very bitter.  this dish was very light and i would not recommend it.  my husband had baked haddock with vegetables and rice which he said was very good.
2021-08-14,Kristina,5.0,loved it. the staff were very pleasant and the food was amazing. can't wait to go back!
2021-08-13,Ballou,5.0,"elizabeth did an excellent job making us welcome again during our first visit in 18 months! food was great although we miss the polenta! we will be back! say hello to judy, sergi, and pat! see you soon! table 521!"
2021-08-13,juliep,4.0,still good but the quality and servings were not as good as i remembered from original ownership.
2021-08-08,ELIOTK,5.0,legals is always great.  getting a bit pricey though.
2021-08-08,GliB1,5.0,"the best fresh seafood, menu is extensive, lovely atmosphere, great service - what more could you want.  the meal service was timed great from appetizer to dessert and coffee. we never felt rushed.

tip for parking:  park to the right of the building housing legal.  it is easier and less risky than trying to find a space right out front."
2021-08-07,MelindaN,5.0,from the time we walked in the service was absolutely amazing ! food . drinks and our server was top notch.  looking forward to visiting again!
2021-08-06,laurap426,4.0,"our server was amazing. great sense of humor, went out of her way to be helpful. the food was fine. good, not amazing. prices are reasonable. we ate outside and the tables are in the shade and comfortable. a big issue was that a truck unloading supplies for the restaurant pulled up right next to us during our lunch. not a great view and it was incredibly noisy. but once we alerted our server, she managed to get them to park a bit away so that was better. we had a dog with us and all of the staff could not have been nicer or friendlier to our pet."
2021-08-05,Mouse,3.0,"what happened to the old legal sea food? the food, even on a limited menu, was substandard, the waiters are no longer professional, and the entire experience was a disappointment. i used to love any of the restaurants, here and in boston, now i will think twice before going there again."
2021-08-05,PattyH,3.0,i was disappointed with my bloody mary it was sour which he happily took off the bill but the smashed potatoes were very starchy and way to many bread crumbs on the haddock that’s all you could taste otherwise very good
2021-08-03,Bobby,4.0,the patio is a side walk in a mall parking lot. covid safe; but also noisy.
2021-08-03,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent service
2021-08-02,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal here.  sat in the bar area with my wife and enjoyed a great margarita, sonoma cutrer chardonnay... crabmeat cocktail, grey sole special, fried shrimp w/fries and the fantastic broccoli casserole.  great service tonight from tyler l... nice job!  we love legal!"
2021-07-30,poochparents,4.0,"my food was not good. fried scallops were soggy and discolored inside, not white. ff were soggy. bang bang cauli was hard. shared boston cream pie was dry and remained uneaten. what happened to you legals? will not rush back."
2021-07-30,Myydine,5.0,we go to legal framingham on a regular basis. the food is outstanding and the service is excellent.
2021-07-30,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food was excellent and our waitress portia was amazing!

2021-07-29,Cynthia,4.0,"lunch was delicious and judy was her usual thoughtful and warm self even though she was very busy!
one complaint to senior mgmt - we want our fish chowder back. clam chowder is all visiting guests know, us newenglanders want our fish chowder back.
framingham location is looking terrific, thanks patrick you made the harsh edges go away! now soft colors and great lighting!

i love the new ‘savage blonde’ oysters ... my new go to starter!

thanks everyone"
2021-07-24,SallyB,3.0,"last two times we have been there the food was bland. we have been going there for years, now we are in no hurry to go back."
2021-07-23,DP01772,4.0,reasonable choices and variety in covid-reduced menu. my filet mignon was not buttery-soft; was it the wrong cut? chowder and tuna taktai appetizers were great.
2021-07-23,Sloane,5.0,always a great choice for perfectly cooked seafood.
2021-07-22,TonyBoston,2.0,"we ordered mussels to start (to share), followed by two entrees - swordfish and crab cake combo.  the mussels took forever and finally came out 2 minutes before our main courses; the mussels were tiny and unsatisfying.  the swordfish was fine, not great, not bad - just fine.  the crab cake was very tasty, the shrimp over cooked and the scallops were microscopic.  definitely not nearly as good quality as pre-covid legals.  i'd recommend waiting another 6 months until legal seafoods has got their act more together."
2021-07-22,JoaniK,5.0,highly recommended.  personalized service with quality and ample food portions
2021-07-21,MargotS,5.0,"as good as ever, though a more limited menu than it used to be."
2021-07-20,KP21,2.0,"i am a frequent visitor to legal’s, and i was surprisingly underwhelmed on this visit. prices have gone way up, portion size was embarrassingly small, and taste was mediocre at best. perhaps the worst experience i’ve had at one of these establishments. extremely disappointed here..."
2021-07-19,Mad1,4.0,"always good food but limited menu, probably due to covid did not include some favorites."
2021-07-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent food and service. seafood  was fresh and absolutely delicious. excellent service!
2021-07-16,Cheryl,5.0,"everything was just fine - except it was disappointing that onion strings has been removed from legal sea foods menu (both lunch and dinner).  that dish was always
a favorite substitution.  our waitress, elizabeth, was nothing but outstanding - we have missed legal seafoods in framingham, but are glad to have finally returned - and, we will
certainly return again!"
2021-07-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,phenomenal food and service!!
2021-07-14,MitchC,3.0,"food was very good although it is disappointing that the new ownership has deleted certain (favorite) items from the prior legal sf menu. after ordering (3) drinks, we waited 35 minutes for our drinks! water showed up 20 minutes after we sat. the service was frankly unacceptable and we probably won't return."
2021-07-13,NancyD,5.0,excellent food & service. very chilly in restaurant & bathrooms were freezing.
2021-07-13,herb,3.0,the crab cakes used to come with a lovely salad.  lettuce and some nuts or berries etc.  now you just get a few pieces of lettuce and some sliced apple slivers.  nothing special and not very much of it.   not sure why they changed it or why they can't afford to do what they had before.
2021-07-12,Millers,5.0,bring back oysters legal please
2021-07-10,TimO,4.0,food was good. maybe a little pricey but decent quality. actually got a different entree  than what i ordered but it i let it go as it was close to what it should have been.
2021-07-10,Roger,5.0,"kudos to all - esp the kitchen, for going above and beyond to make gluten-free crabcakes for my wife."
2021-07-06,somethingoranother85,4.0,excellent service and the food very good. new menu items as well.
2021-07-05,TripAdvisor,5.0,"excellent chow and libation, as always... great service from autumn!  tonight, tried a few of their new items... the st. louis ribs w/coffee bbq sauce... great, the meat falls off the bone and meaty.  the snake river farms wagyu bacon cheddar burger... loved it.  the seafood items.... crab cake and lump crabmeat cocktail, so good!  

very highly recommended"
2021-07-05,Nonickname,5.0,used opentable for 8pm res. got there at 645 due to good luck at logan and light traffic. our table was already waiting for us. food was...as always....outstanding.
2021-07-04,LivM,5.0,make reservations. great food. service was really good. food came out with perfect timing.
2021-07-03,TRACIEC,3.0,"legal has really cut the menu back and doesn’t offer anything that you can’t get somewhere else.  their fried clam dinner is much smaller, they don’t offer a variety of fish, such as trout, just the same tuna/salmon/halibut/swordfish you can get at so many other places.  the oysters were, as usual, fresh and tasty, but at $3 we should not be picking large pieces of shell out.  we sat at the bar, and the staff was friendly and took good care of us.  the food is fine, but at legal prices, they should be special."
2021-07-02,csoup1,3.0,"still a limited menu.  maybe this is how is going to be from now on? chowder is always spot on! crab cake/shrimp/scallops, were a little over cooked, and sizes have shrunk.  overall, good, just wishing for the old legal's with many choices of top quality seafood."
2021-07-02,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great food, great service."
2021-07-02,Cynthia,4.0,"sadly we hit legal on a day when lots of training was going on with serving as well as chef staff!
one of my favs are “stuffies”, stuffed ri style clams... they arrived cool vs screaming hot...and plate was returned without replacing my order, but reheating it! with covid still around, thought this was nasty... this expensive app was nothing like the ones i love.... disappointment! then my calamari arrived as tough as nails.

if it weren’t for our server, dear portia, lunch would have been a c-, she tried so hard to make it right!

i know the must train staff but geez, the gal at the next table tried 3 times to get a clam roll, each time a trainee brought out a crab roll. her husband had finished before she got her clam roll...

manager patrick was not there, or this never would have happened. we love patrick’s hard work and the staff he skillfully guides.

this doesn’t change my feelings about legal, but yesterday was a bust."

2021-06-25,porlier,5.0,"food prepared perfectly: tuna grilled rare, green beans crunchy, asparagus just right, caesar salad with not too much dressing.

miss the old menu with variety of fish for grilling.    also, regret not having more wine by-the-bottle choices.

very satisfying meal."
2021-06-25,FredF,4.0,"i had ordered lobster mac and cheese which was great.  my plate, the lobster was missing the 2 claws so i had assumed that the meat was inside and it was not.  i had noticed next table had order the same and their lobster came with the 2 claws.

no big deal, we all enjoyed the great good and service."

2021-06-16,HopeW,5.0,"simply an extraordinary meal!  the hot lobster roll and new england chowder are a must!
service was spectacular and our meals and experience could not have been any better.  it was pricey, but worth it for our special occasion."

i would not recommend this location 
been going there forever but will not go back for a long time"
2021-06-11,Joanie,4.0,"menu is not as exceptional since ownership changed, menu is more limited, no wild caught salmon for example."
2021-06-11,Millers,5.0,ate at the bar and eugenio was outstanding.  one of the most polite and efficient bartenders i’ve done across.  a true gentleman.  food was as outstanding as it’s been past 20 years.  sadly when they sold out to the new owners they removed oysters legal which was one of the most amazing dishes.
2021-06-10,PatrickW,5.0,"a boston favorite of ours. excellent food, outstanding service, unique ambiance. we keep returning in this restaurant and other legal restaurants"
2021-06-10,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"fried clam app was tough and chewy. 
anna haddock was dry.
house salad was very good as well as tomato balsamic.
watermelon slush cocktail was tasteless, granted i asked for no sugar."
2021-06-09,LisaK,5.0,i have enjoyed dining at different legal seafood locations since the original one when i was a teenager in the 70's. food is fresh and delicious and they are always adding fun new ways of cooking fish too. my very favorite is the baked haddock with buttery crumbs and tomato on top-best ever. the clam chowder is amazingly yummy too.
2021-06-07,Petie,2.0,food was mediocre compared to prices
2021-06-07,TommyG,2.0,the wait staff were unprofessional and not attentive. if a meal for two is going to cost over $200 the quality of staff should match the quality of food.
2021-06-04,OpenTable Diner,5.0,honestly they have so much to choose from food wise and they are amazing when it comes to the service. especially the people at the front they are so welcoming! thank you
2021-06-02,Maggie,5.0,jared is outstanding - very friendly and extremely helpful with my elderly friend.
2021-06-01,Foodguy,3.0,"dined on a slow weeknight for our anniversary. calamari app was excellent. entrees we’re good, but not outstanding. overall experience has slipped considerably.  not as many menu options, ambiance a big downgrade and much more chain-like. not sure if it’s post covid or the new ownership."
2021-06-01,MarieG,5.0,"our exuberant server, portia, set the tone and made us feel welcome. i had the seafood combo plate.  all seafood was cooked tasty, especially the crab cake.  i found the apple fennel salad refreshing.  i also enjoyed the ice cream bon bons for dessert."
2021-05-31,Underwhelming,4.0,you can always count on legal for excellent quality food. we ordered ri calamari appetizer. it was excellent but it took a very very long time to arrive and then our dinners arrived right after we finished. it would have been nicer to have a little lag time between appetizer and dinner. we ordered the crab cake-grilled scallops and shrimp and the baked stuffed shrimp. both were excellent and the crab cake and stuffing were both 99% crab. the sides were also excellent.
2021-05-31,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"legal seafood has gone down hill, not the same experience. 
for $40 avg pp for lunch i’d rather go elsewhere"
2021-05-31,Kurt,5.0,excellent food and service as we've come to expect!
2021-05-30,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"i have always been a fan of legal, but lately things have been changing in my opinion for the worse at least for menu items i have always loved. i have always loved their jasmine rice, but they changed it for a rice pilaf. while ok, i don’t understand why you can’t have both options for customers who may want either. i have always loved their french fries, but last night i saw that they changed them to a different style, closer to steak fries. they are much larger french fries and have a seasoning which is ok, but their previous fries were better in my opinion. lastly, i wanted swordfish steak, and they were out of it, so i had to substitute for something else. so overall the service was good, but my main meal was just ok. i don’t know why legal continues to change what was working but it makes me question returning for a while because i don’t crave the changes they’ve made."

2021-05-19,Traveler,1.0,"awful. this is not a legal seafoods i have been eating yet for the past 40 years. while they have grown and changed over the years the quality of their food has been consistent. now that they have sold to new management the only thing that they have retained is the name. french fries were frozen and tasteless, fried fish was made with pollick rather than cod. there was no cod on the menu, no sole. every dish was covered in 10,000 cal worth of breadcrumbs,  butter and sugar. ugh! with any luck they haven’t changed the chowder, but you can buy that online direct from the originals to legal seafoods. we will not be back"

2021-05-07,DebraC,5.0,"portia was our server and she was friendly, courteous, and responsive to whatever we needed at our table. although everyone in my party was vaccinated, the large, round table for five was big enough for us to keep some social distancing from one another, and apart at least 6 ft from other tables. mask wearing was enforced when not seated. the food was excellent and enjoyed by all."
2021-05-07,mollyo,4.0,"first visit under new ownership.  chowder good but a little different taste.  fried clams better- coating a little lighter.  broth for mussels not as good, and bread for dipping was crouton hard and not good.  prices are high which affected value rating."
2021-05-07,Steve,5.0,"fish taco, fish and chips, and lobster roll; nothing fancy here but fresh, hot, great portions, and the service was super. the lobster roll is huge!

2021-04-30,JohnS,4.0,"happy people greeted us at the door. 
waiter was attentive. not pushy.

nice to get out again.😀"
2021-04-29,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal tonight. lump crabmeat cocktail w/mustard sauce... excellent. tuna sashimi always great. baked stuffed shrimp returned to the menu... stuffed with crab... very good. i like the brocolli, potatoes could be improved (bring back mashed or baked). a few bon bons for dessert.. have loved these things for 40 years! margarita and chardonnay, my favorite libations here. great service from serge."
2021-04-29,MichelleH,2.0,food takes forever.. server was so busy only came once to check on us and she also brought us the wrong side dish. we ordered coleslaw but she brought us asparagus instead. my husband allergic to asparagus but we didn’t ask to change the whole thing instead of asked her to give us coleslaw on the side. however the whole dinner was ok just slow and wrong order.
2021-04-26,Micky,4.0,it's the first time during covid-19 that we came inside legal.  we were impressed with the plexiglass partitions.  the waitress took care with our food delivery.   my lobster roll was beyond expectations.  everyone enjoyed their meal.  tuna cooked perfectly.  lemon shrimp was very good as was the whole lobster meal.

2021-04-18,JAMES,3.0,the fried clams were not as good as they were in the past.  the crab cake combo plate was cold.  not what we have experienced in the past.
2021-04-18,LindsayD,5.0,sat at the bar to watch the celtics play. ordered the crab cake and two entrees. lobster mac and cheese was good. shrimp linguine was filling. the cucumber habanero margarita was amazing!

2021-04-17,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"have not dined here since covid began.  recently visited and was vastly disappointed in the quality of food.  quality is much less but prices have not dropped.  can get a better fish and chips meal at the 99 for 40% less cost, more food, and better quality.  i will return and try them again, but if the food quality is similar to this time, they will be out of my dining rotation."

i promise to try everything new the next time, i believe i’m in. shrimp rut!"
2021-04-11,ParticularlyPicky,4.0,food was good. i have several food allergies and they were super accommodating. our waitress was very friendly and nice.  recommend this place for great seafood and service. very nice decor too.
2021-04-11,Daniel,1.0,"very disappointed!  i have been going to legal's for 30 years. they pioneered delicious gluten-free batter fried seafood when gluten-free was not even well known or popular. the new owners are killing legal's reputation. there were few items on the menu that were gluten-free, most of which were fried seafood entrees. but, their fryers are no longer gluten-free because they now offer beer-battered fish. therefore, all of their fried items are no longer gluten-free. their menu is very limited now, and they have removed some of our favorites like the lite clam chowder. my wife has celiac so gluten-free is a must for us. when we asked the waitress (she was also gluten-free) what was safe to order she suggested a salad. we felt like we were back in the 1980s as far as allergy-friendly. in times where all restaurants are becoming allergy aware, legal's has done an about-face and turned their backs on people with allergies which is very disappionting as legal's was one of our favorite restaurant. not anymore. 
roger berkowitz should have never sold to this restaurant group."
2021-04-10,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great ambiance, we sat at the bar. bartenders were attentive and very friendly. it took a little bit longer than usual for our food to be served, but everything was delicious! all in all, a lovely evening."
2021-04-10,Cbeau69,3.0,"our waiter was very nice and very attentive. however, we felt that the food was ordinary. my husband planned to get your gumbo but it was off the menu so he got a grilled chicken caesar. not much chicken and the lettuce was all hearts - no flavor at all. i chose the fried scallops which were the winner from a taste perspective, but, grossly overpriced. side of asparagus was completely plain and unseasoned. our oysters were excellent but a couple of little shell pieces snuck in and they weren’t completely loosened from the shell. my father order the scampi which was very good. we just felt that, for the prices, we expected a little more than ordinary. we walked out of there spending $140 for some fried scallops, plain asparagus, a caesar salad and four large shrimp with a lot of pasta. we were just kind of disappointed. also, if you’re going to offer gluten-free rolls you guys need to step up your game because those were the worst rolls i’ve ever had in my entire life. they were completely inedible and crumbled in my hands. i really think you guys need to start thinking about the details a little bit more if you’re going to charge the prices that you’re charging. sorry."
2021-04-09,AlanC,3.0,"waitress was good. the food was not very well prepared 
there was to much batter on the fish,shrimp &scallops.

2021-04-03,MarinaS,5.0,legal seafood is always a good choice.  the food is fresh and service is good!
2021-04-03,PeterD,2.0,"the menu and other aspects of the restaurant are in transition to new ownership. menu items are limited in comparison to the past and, although the food was good and the service very good, it was disappointing because many of our favorite items are gone. we are long time legal seafood fans and actually have a “white card”, signed by mr berkowitz, which instructed the reception staff to seat us immediately at the next available table regardless of the wait list - it is no longer respected. i suppose in today’s environment all this is “progress”!"
2021-04-02,Tina,3.0,"underwhelming and overpriced.  we went on a friday night after a long week so decided to treat ourselves with a meal at a more upscale restaurant.  

server was pleasant enough but kind of hyper which made it a bit difficult to understand what she was saying.  she was pretty attentive early in the meal but got less so once our meals were served and forgot to bring us additional rolls that we had asked for before our meals were served.

the real reason for our disappointment was the 'value' of the meals.  i got the crab cake combo - 1 crab cake, 2 grilled shrimp and 2 scallops with a small-ish salad containing some mixed greens a couple nuts and cranberries. it was $33.  taste-wise it was fine but half the plate was taken up by the salad and it did not feel like there was enough food to justify the price.  (legal's prices continue to increase and the portions have just gotten smaller.) next time i would save myself $15 and just get the crab cake appetizer.  

worse yet - my 18-yer old son decided to try the lobster mac & cheese off the 'test kitchen' menu.  it was noted as market price....but we were shocked when we found it was $42 when the check was presented.  it was awful and not worth half of that price.  it was some cavatappi noodles with a small amount of white 'cheese' sauce that had absolutely no flavor at all. it was served in the shell of a lobster.  there were chunks of the lobster but whole pieces - not distributed, cut up or mixed in - placed around the noodles.  it was all covered in breadcrumbs which appeared to have been then broiled. the lobster meat was very overcooked and chewy.  my son was very disappointed but absolutely hates sending food back, so he just more or less picked through it a bit and then just watched his father and i eat our meals.  it was quite surprising for a place that is supposed to be experts in seafood. 

had we seen a manager around, we would have given them a heads up as to our concerns."
2021-03-29,Choirboyz,5.0,the classic legal favorites like chowder and salmon and my personal favorite the surf and turf (filet with seared scallops) was outstanding.  the service was excellent (attentive but not overbearing) ... will definitely be back for the fried clam appetizer... it made for a great evening

2021-03-15,AnnC,5.0,"like to try new to me items. appetizer was the raw tuna. expected it to be ground like steak tartare; however, it was sliced - tasty."
2021-03-08,Doriane,5.0,we went to celebrate our anniversary. we had not been at legal since the beginning of the pandemic. it was wonderful to be back there.  the staff was wonderful and welcoming and the food was amazing!  we highly recommend going to legal seafood in natick
2021-03-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"legal is always reliable serving delicious food, impeccably clean and good service. 
i don’t want to throw people under the bus especially with restaurants suffering but just some easy fixes. 
they’ve done a major menu change. that’s fine. with a lower volume of diners, that is understandable. 
when we went to order, my friend and i wanted a side salad. they don’t offer that anymore. server informed us that there was only one salad available and easily shareable. so we ordered it. we both figured it would be a garden salad since that was what we originally requested. server did not advise otherwise. it was a greek salad. no mention of it when we ordered. aside from any allergy concerns, server should inform guest that though we requested side garden salads, all that was available was the greek salad. 
last part was that we sat for twenty plus minutes after our meal before we flagged her down for the check. it wasn’t overly busy. just the same, another lapse."

2021-03-02,OldGent,4.0,"sat at bar around 1.30.  bartender not friendly.  no greeting.  no follow up on food.  bartender attitude doesn't set a welcoming environment.  certainly not on this day.

btw --- draft beer not available.  why offer if its not going to be available........"
2021-02-28,RonR,4.0,"our server was a little forgetful, had to ask for my bar drink, she forgot. when we asked for new salad plates she made an excuse about ""scuffs"" rather than just changing them for us.  the lobster is extremely expensive, especially since we are in new england. 
the value was very poor."
2021-02-28,RoughNightatTuscan,4.0,the food and service at legal is also very good.  good value for a healthy lunch!
2021-02-27,TripAdvisor,5.0,"as good as legal was, it continues to improve under the new ownership!  the menu is expanding to include some of our missing favorites that were taken away under the covid cloud, and new items are being added like lump crabmeat cocktail.  sides also expanded, but still miss either a baked potato or mashed.

our meal was excellent tonight.  highlights included the aforementioned crab cocktail, the tuna sashimi, crabcake, fried shrimp.  really enjoyed the newly added brocolli au gratin side.

service from porche... perfect."

2021-02-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"legal changed their menu, and no longer serve jasmine rice. replaced it with rice pilaf, which was ok. while it’s ok to have multiple rice options and i encourage it i don’t understand why you would get rid of a basic side such as jasmine rice. why not have both? some people might like brown rice for example. again why not have options. to me jasmine rice is a very simple add-on to a menu that doesn’t require that much effort or cost that much to have on hand. that was a bit disappointing."
2021-02-13,MikeP,5.0,great food great service a little quiet due to covid!!
2021-02-13,SgtFrancis,5.0,my waitress was awesome! the food was outstanding. i’ll def return.

2021-02-08,porlier,5.0,"excellent and friendly service by arthur. 

we are big fans of legal seafood and hope not much changes with new ownership, especially outstanding wine choices and pricing."
2021-02-06,Cynthia,5.0,"wonderful to be back... legal’s been sorely missed, new menu lots of fun new items!

the perfect cosmo, fried large shrimp(so good), broccoli au gratin is a total keeper,the new rice was a disappointment, why not pilaf? the new rice was dry  and too much green pepper...no thanks! desserts need refreshing... no excitement! 

we loved  being back and can hardly wait to visit again. thank you patrick...."
2021-02-05,Christopher,5.0,big fan of this restaurant.
2021-02-04,michael,2.0,"it seems that food quality has diminished since new owners have taken over. what was to be baked stuffed colossal shrimp were what appeared to be 4 u16 shrimp with some stuffing, some rice and asparagus for $32. very poor value and a disappointing dish. service was ok but the place looked a bit rundown and disheveled. won’t go back and that is sad as i have eaten there many times before."
2021-01-31,LynnS,5.0,terrific server.   excellent covid protocols.    would return for special occasions
2021-01-31,MarieG,5.0,"i took my daughters to lunch and we were all in the mood for lobster.  both girls had the lobster rolls (one butter poached and one traditional) and i had the baked stuffed lobster.  the food was superb as was the service and i enjoyed my glass of sancerre that paired perfectly with my meal.  while the market price of lobster isn't inexpensive, it was worth it."
2021-01-30,TripAdvisor,5.0,"covid rules keep the dining room very quiet.  was ""covid full"" on our visit, so make sure you reserve.  another excellent meal, especially important after the monumental sale by the berkowitz family... my second post sale visit.  happy to report that they are doing great.. looking to add to the menu within days.  they had a special tonight... a lump crabmeat.... was fantastic. 

loved our seared tuna and fried shrimp. 

legal rules!!!"
2021-01-29,RayD,5.0,"once again, legal did not disappoint - great place that consistently nails it with great food and service."
2021-01-28,BonnieP,5.0,excellent service by our waiter. he was very personable
2021-01-28,Michael,5.0,"the food was outstanding, i got the standard fish and chips, it was not greasy at all the fries also light and crispy, it was awesome. the staff was very attentive polite and courteous. the over all cleanliness was excellent i spent 3 hours there talking with a friend from los angeles and i noticed every time a patron would leave the dining area or bar it was wiped down and cleaned. 

my one con: and this was no fault of legal seafood was the plexiglas partitions, i can't wait until covid is gone!

~mike"
2021-01-27,MichaelH,4.0,"was disappointed with the baked stuff lobster, as it appeared and tasted overdone and burnt.  usually a ""go to"" meal for this place.  waitress was exceptional and was able to get a replacement dinner very promptly.  over all a good experience, and hope for the baked stuffed to be on point again next time."
2021-01-24,Lovetodineout,4.0,"overall positive experience, but both of our salmon dishes were not cooked as requested. appetizer was deducted from bill to ease our frustration."
2021-01-23,Suzi,5.0,lump crab was outstanding and so was the blackened salmon.  looking forward to next time.
2021-01-21,Millers,5.0,great bar service.  bring back oysters legal!!!
2021-01-16,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal, even during covid restrictions, is excellent.  loved our crab cakes and fried shrimp.  a more expanded menu is coming shortly!  can't wait!!"
2021-01-16,Barbara,5.0,"management is very very conscious of safety during the pandemic.  the need to wear a mask except when actually eating or drinking is bothersome, but it is necessary and so most of the people were doing it.  not the restaurant's fault to make this part of the protocol.  keeps those who agree with the requirement safer."
2021-01-15,KarenS,5.0,i really enjoyed my meal and this was the first time we have been out to eat in quite a while due to the corona virus.   service was great.
2021-01-14,James,4.0,we went for the appetizer diner and salad.  excellent as always.  had a high top table in the bar area and felt very safe
2021-01-13,Marcia,5.0,"very personable and attentive wait staff.
food was very tasty."
2021-01-13,OpenTableDiner,2.0,"we understand it’s times of covid and respect there are guidelines to follow, but didn’t appreciate being asked if we knew them and when the staff member who had asked looked as if they didn’t believe me, then asked me to recite back what they were. it was supposed to be a nice dinner out, not dining in a concentration camp. the server though provided great service. but the start to the evening at the restaurant pretty much ruined the night. there’s definitely a lot of improvements that needs to be made there."
2021-01-11,CherylI,3.0,it was okay fish and chips was not flavorful. was supposed to spicy and it wasn’t.
2021-01-10,Jenny,3.0,our server was fantastic but the restaurant needs an overhaul.  shabby curtains that were torn up and crooked.  the manager or owner needs to renovate a little.
2021-01-09,TripAdvisor,5.0,"still great... no worries

after the sale of legal seafoods was announced, i was interested to see if there was any change. i am happy to say our dinner was excellent, as usual. as a matter of fact, they improved the fried shrimp. the shrimp are large and plump... was perfect. if you didn't know there was a sale you wouldn't realize it... same staff, same excellent chow and service.

at this time, they only allow 25% of the restaurant to be seated... so it was ""full"" but very quiet. we sat in the lounge so we could keep an eye on the football playoffs.

fantastic service from jeffrey... who's been there for years.

very highly recommended... still!"
2021-01-09,FernandoC,4.0,i did ask for two margaritas and i was so excited but the margaritas was terrible
2021-01-08,Ovar,3.0,"overcooked, not testy food, definitely downgraded compared to times before. unfortunately, but will not go to this location anymore."
2021-01-07,mich,2.0,"that location needs a rehab, its very old, dirty and the staff didn't seem to care about their appearance or the beat down tables and booths. i felt like i was eating in friendly's we found a brown soft hunk of something in our bread, both meals were overcooked and not very tasty. the one shining star was the gentleman that greeted and seated us (i think his name was tony) unfortunately we never saw him again.

2021-01-05,Gball94,5.0,we came for my husbands 29th birthday. group of five from worcester. our waiter was fantastic. as it was a tuesday so there wasn’t any wait and the noise was low. it was a very pleasant experience and will definitely come again.
2021-01-03,BethS,4.0,chowder and salmon were good but the rice seemed like it was old and reheated. bread seemed stale too
2021-01-01,OpenTable Diner,4.0,my crab cake was excellent but my wife's casserole was a little too rich for her tastes.
2021-01-01,MaryannK,1.0,"i was very disappointed in my meal and the prices. my grandson got a 1 1/4 lobster that looked over cooked for $49. my son got fried clams that tasted ok but only got about 8. i got fish and chips which was also dry and overcooked, didn't even eat half of it. i won't be returning."
2021-01-01,JoedithH,5.0,"the restaurant gave us a quiet table and the atmosphere was very quiet.our server
was very attentive and we were able to converse at length since there were so
few guests. there were 5 of us in the party and we all enjoyed the afternoon."
2021-01-01,JeffreyF,3.0,the menu choices have been reduced so much that many of my favorites are missing.  other restaurant appear to have done a better job with their food supply chain that legal seafood.  may also be due to change inn ownership.  hope it can return to what made it special in the past.
2021-01-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"new year’s eve dinner. sergey, our waiter was awesome. great service, great food!"
2020-12-31,JoelP,5.0,great food great service. all around great experience.
2020-12-31,JaniceG,5.0,it was very good from the time we walked in.
2020-12-28,KarenO,2.0,"went for a business lunch. it's just not the same legal it used to be. all the food was just okay. our server was great but one of my coworkers smelled an amonia-like odor after a few bites of his hot lobster roll. we all smelled it and agreed....and one of our other guests also had the same item and his did not have this smell. the server handled it perfectly....but when the manager came over he said ""i hear you had a problem with your lobster roll. we've served 10 of them today and nobody else had a problem but i will remove it from your bill."" very inappropriate. i know covid puts a strain on everyone and everything but something like this is completely controllable - it's not the food issue, it's the way it was handled."
2020-12-27,HaroldB,5.0,the waitress  was great portia is the best waitress we ever had
2020-12-24,Kandace,4.0,"my family has been going to legal seafood framingham every christmas eve for 14 years. i understand that covid has brought new challenges but i was disappointed that the menu was so different. not many choices, seemed more like pub food than what we were use too! 

also, upon arriving the female hostess was nice and welcoming. she asked the male host to take us to our table, he responded “what? you want me to take them? fine, well, come with me.” he was not pleasant and was dismissive."
2020-12-19,KarinN,5.0,we were celebrating the holiday season and our engagement.
2020-12-18,MarkS,5.0,food quality and service was excellent. quiet but great atmosphere. prices are bit high for the food and wine but the food quality and wine selection makes it’s worthwhile.
2020-12-16,James,4.0,velf very safe sitting in the bar area.  recommend it to anyone
2020-12-07,MichelleH,1.0,"so disappointing. the menu is horrible portions are smaller than ever! 
plus it was so cold we had to keep our winter coats on.  
couldn’t leave soon enough!"
2020-12-05,OpenTable Diner,5.0,our waitress was excellent. truly one of the best we have ever had anywhere. i think her name was porscha.

2020-11-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"this place is a gem! everyone in our party licked their plates clean. the lobster meat in the lobster rolls was the freshest and most tender we have ever had. great service, very clean, and lots of space so you feel like your in your own private restaurant. we will be back for another meal or for drinks in their beautiful bar!"
2020-11-20,csoup1,4.0,"probably not fair to knock it down just a little due to the limited menu.  but, service was outstanding, quality very good, just wish a few more choices."
2020-11-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"though the menu is limited due to the situation with covid-19, the food was great and on time. staff very friendly and helpful."

2020-11-14,TMDM,4.0,"we dined in the bar area and felt that the setup was well spaced and safe.

p.s.  the restaurant initially listed me as a “no-show”, although i did honor this reservation."
2020-11-14,Bottomline222,4.0,"legal always does a good job in spite of the limited menu due to covid hours. however, we are really tired of the “all day menu” that has no sole or the thai calamari appetizer on the menu. instead of once a week at legal we’ll do it every 3 weeks and explore other places that have seafood."
2020-11-14,SandyP,5.0,"our waitress was the most efficient server i have ever come across. she is a huge asset to legal.

2020-11-13,Rick,3.0,"we had a great early dinner this past friday.  our waiter was exceptional.  both our dinners were delicious.  our only disappointment was,  and i know it is a covid thing, was the small, limited menu."
2020-11-08,ElizabethD,5.0,fresh fish was excellent. i had the swordfish and my husband had the salmon. highly recommend this restaurant.
2020-11-07,James,4.0,"my wife and i stopped in for a lite dinner. just our favorite appetizers.  the sashimi was excellent as usual.  we also ordered the shrimp cocktail, which we have always considered the best in town.  wow were we disappointed, the shrimp were very small (half the normal size) and way over cooked.  i hope that is not what legal is planning to do in the future."
2020-11-06,DouglasJ,5.0,great service and food

2020-10-30,RayD,5.0,"once again legal did not disappoint.  dined there friday evening and was greeted by a friendly and professional hostess.  surprisingly, it wasn't very crowded but there was more than adequate social distancing of the tables.  our waiter was excellent - a true professional and gentleman!  and, as expected the food was great!  also, we were allowed to take our time and relax.  very pleased with the entire experience."
2020-10-30,MarieG,5.0,out to dinner with my daughter.  we had very friendly and fast service with a delicious meal of a luscious lobster roll and jumbo crab combo plate finishing with a molten chocolate lava cake.

2020-10-11,suzythcatt1,5.0,"we were seated promptly. they do have properly distanced indoor seating as well as patio seating with heaters. service was prompt, and pleasant. our waiter did an a+ job of seeing that were had what we needed without being intrusive, kind without being folksy or over familiar, a true professional. the food was outstanding. fried food had a delicious, light batter and was not at all greasy steamed food was flavorful and neither under nor over cooked. perfect staled broccoli is a rare treat. the bread was warm, the butter was soft enough to spread. even the coffee was really good.the soft lighting was romantic, but not so dark that you couldn't tell what you were eating. we will be back."

2020-10-09,TripAdvisor,5.0,"they are handling covid rules very well here, as you would expect. chow and service is fantastic, as usual. cocktails, wine hit the spot.

2020-10-01,BigD,4.0,"seated outside for late lunch on the patio on a wonderful, sunny, 70+ degree afternoon, we had a house salad with scallops, and the salmon entree with great green beans and broccoli.  the service was excellent, prompt and friendly.  the wine was delicious."

2020-09-27,RichP,2.0,clam chowder was fair.  sashimi wasn't great.  chicken sandwich with fries was good.
2020-09-27,LarryO,4.0,"we came for a late lunch.  food was excellent, as was the service.  there was a scaled down menu, so some of the choices we would normally see were missing.  most likely due to reduced volume.  felt very comfortable and safe with the precautions in place."
2020-09-26,FredB,2.0,"wow, finally back at legal (framingham) and it was awful.   while it was not crowded food prep was forever fish & chips and a shrimp paster order, 25 minutes, really?  worse of all was a couple (50's) having a facetime video chat while they stuffed their faces and talked so loud it was disturbing. yes, we complained, no one did anything maybe because of their race and did not want to ignite something who knows but we will not be going back!"
2020-09-26,TOM14369,4.0,the menu is more limited now with covid. if you lik seafood there is something for you but check the menu ahead of time. good food still

2020-09-26,AaronJ,4.0,wasn’t a fan of sitting outdoors on the sidewalk with nearly no light other than the street lights. otherwise it was a fine experience
2020-09-26,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great spot.
2020-09-26,RickO,4.0,"legal seafoods as a whole is a miracle.  i have eaten at various locations for 20+ years and the high quality and constancy of experience always impresses me. the establishments are clean, the staff always friendly and professional.    a very well run restaurant group with fresh wonderful seafood. 
the framingham location is no exception with a vibrant bar, plenty of parking and now during ""covid season"",  pleasant outdoor dining.   roger is a genius and a very nice man."
2020-09-24,JamesO,5.0,"we are frequent diners here. since covid, we hven't gone but decided to try it again. food was excellent as usual. service was above and beyond. clearly hey are taking precautions seriously. drinks were strong and well made. selection of dishes was different but stll satisfying. we plan to restart our patronage"
2020-09-22,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"with about 5 tables in the restaurant, i’d expect a more attentive server with quicker service. we sat and waited close to 15 minutes before being acknowledged. once our drink order was placed and an appetizer, our server disappeared for 18 more minutes. we finally placed our dinner order. between the first 3 plates being delivered and the other 3 plates it was almost 10 minutes. we sat waiting for the whole tables meals so we could begin eating. they knew we were coming and there’d be 6 of us. why not plan better on their end?? the server stumbled with the explanation of the specials and was missing the majority of the dinner. we realized he was in the darkened room with the door closed next to our table. another server called him out to tend to us. very dissatisfied and disappointed. almost $300 bill and the service did not meet the grade."
2020-09-22,Rockin4,4.0,"i had a lobster roll, which was delicious, but it did have a shell in it. service was great."
2020-09-21,CatherineN,5.0,as always the food was excellent! our server was very attentive and met all our needs.  the atmosphere was great. will definitely go back!
2020-09-20,Marie,2.0,this used to be one of my family's favorite restaurants but the experience we just had was mediocre at best. seeing how there were only 3 people there that evening maybe that was a sign. they stated they didn't have oysters due to covid yet we've been to many other restaurants in the area recently and there was no issue getting oysters any where else. it was very disappointing. also 2 of us ordered scallops and were shocked by the tiny 5-6 pieces that were served. our waitress was very nice and attentive but we most likely won't return.
2020-09-19,MaryC,5.0,a little too much seasoning/oil on the sea scallops.
2020-09-18,bobbieJ,4.0,reservation was made. table was ready when we arrived. the food was good and the service was quick and friendly. thought that the price and the portions were good. i would go there again.
2020-09-13,Stephanie,3.0,food was not as good as it used to be - fried clams were burnt to ashes- not busy there at all- food should have been perfect
2020-09-13,Elroy0415,5.0,great service and the food was excellent highly recommended
2020-09-12,ConnieA,3.0,menu is limited and maybe a bit pricey. outside seating was cold because there are no outdoor heaters yet
2020-09-10,Robert,5.0,legal seafoods is always fresh and varied. their wine list is extensive.
2020-09-09,PattyP,3.0,"we made a call ahead to ask if the restaurant was serving raw clams oysters and were assured that they were.

we also requested only outdoor seating. when we arrived we were told there would be a 30-40 minute wait for outdoor seating even though we had reservations.

we were disappointed but understood.

then when we ordered we were told there was no raw bar and they hadn’t been serving any raw shellfish all summer.

why would the hostess tell us that they were?

our servers were fine, but we were very unhappy about the false information. legal is usually one of our favorites."
2020-09-08,jaytmoods,4.0,"with about 10 tables set up alongside the restaurant and a portion of the parking lot blocked off so that you are not directly next to cars, the outdoor dining experience was nice. sure, cars are zooming along route 9 nearby, but it was still nice. 

the food was impeccable. i’m glad i added a skewer of scallops to my salmon. both were fantastic. 

the “top shelf” margarita was one of the worst i’ve be ever had, though. someone needs to teach the bartender how to make one."
2020-09-07,Caroled,1.0,"omg!  what happened to legals?  food was way below par, very very limited and not at all up to the legal standards.  is is covid?  i am sorry roger berkowitz but even though business is obviously down, the quality should still be up.  bad food.  sorry"
2020-09-07,Cynthia,5.0,"again, had the best time, so blissful not to think about food, but just to eat it!
had a wonderful surprise, an addition to the wait staff... a stellar young woman,portia, who not only knew what she was doing, was delightful and thought of everything!
i’d say this was a great catch for legal.
ps those fried shrimp i dream about.... 
i think i have to say legal is my fav place to enjoy the best quality food."
2020-09-06,CADS,5.0,"although they didn't have oysters or steamers the fried clams and calamari were delicious and very fresh.  the lobster was outstanding and the crab cake, shrimp and scallop combo was also delicious.  the seasonal salad was a great surprise.  it wasn't your usual side salad. it had different type lettuces and cranberries:  delicious."
2020-09-04,TripAdvisor,5.0,"such a great spot... nothing nearly as good in the general area.  tonight, after a margarita (they are great here) had a small salad w/creamy peppercorn... and an order of fried shrimp.  service from serge, excellent."

this is one of my favorite restaurants but very disappointed this time."
2020-09-01,BeckyB,5.0,"we dined outside for lunch on a tuesday, in their newly opened patio area. our waitress, portia, was outstanding, very attentive to our every need. the food did not disappoint and we were pleased with the care taken to keep things as safe and clean as possible."
2020-08-31,RiaM,5.0,legal seafood is a predictable restaurant in our suburban market. it always has very fresh seafood with good portions at a slightly higher price point than competing restaurants in the market. anyone who can operate in this environment needs kudos but especially the staff and managers who made our lunch special.
2020-08-30,Ponderpie,1.0,food was aweful
2020-08-29,aprila,3.0,"the service was nice, everyone was very welcoming. our server was friendly. the food was just ok. small portions, not great quality, and the kids mac & cheese was microwaved kraft (yuck!). i know it’s a seafood restaurant but my kids were expecting homemade mac. the adults orders seafood and it just was not great. the chowder was very good though."
2020-08-29,GabrielaM,5.0,great service. the service was prompt and efficient. loved legal

2020-08-27,SusanG,5.0,"the server went above and beyond to serve us in a closed outdoor section because we didn't want to sit inside.  he was incredibly attentive despite having to go in and out to serve us.  i really appreciate the extra effort they went through for us.  and the food was perfectly cooked and served, as always."
2020-08-26,mikeo,4.0,"as always, great and fresh food. service was as always pleasant and correct."
2020-08-26,Cynthia,4.0,"it was wonderful and has become our only dine in restaurant! third week in a row...
only problem was that they really didn’t understand how to use my open table reward points, nor did i .... really open table go back to you reward debit card. this new approach is a major inconvenience.
this no way reflects on legal seafood, but on you all at open table!
would love to discuss the usage of these miles - you are holding at least 20,000 hostage.
thank you

2020-08-25,OpenTable Diner,3.0,limited menu was not great
2020-08-23,BrianK,5.0,"excellent as always. missed the energy of other patrons portia was great not use to the quiet associated with legal. the hustle and bustle of many people in the was missing.
food great beer cold staff excellent.
lets get through this together. see you guys soon."
2020-08-21,TripAdvisor,5.0,"as usual, legal offered up a great meal... excellent service, awesome chow, nice libation (margaritas, wines).  today the tuna was perfect, crab cake as well.  fried shrimp and sides excellent.  great tabke spacing for covid guidelines.

love it here"
2020-08-21,henryb,5.0,have always enjoyed dining at legal and the quality of service and food does not change at the different locations.  the food is excellent and the service has always been excellent also.
2020-08-20,MarkB,2.0,"with the exception of the lobster roll, the food was disappointing. calamari texture and taste suggested it had been cooked, cooled, and then dipped in a deep fryer to reheat before serving. same for the french fries. the rolls appeared to be not fresh.

no raw bar available."
2020-08-20,PattyP,4.0,"great to have a meal out! our first since february and we did eat out, as in outside, not the norm for most legal seafoods. food was good, but a very limited menu and no raw bar, though it was listed on the menu.

service was adequate, but some tables got napkins and straws and some did not."
2020-08-19,RobertB,5.0,enjoyed our dinner there there the other night. .   food was delicious. will go again
2020-08-18,JanyceG,5.0,"the waiter was so pleasant and enjoyable, the food terrific. it was sad to see it so empty because of the pandemic rules but i would certainly recommend going there to anyone."
2020-08-16,josephi,5.0,"very enjoyable, not very busy. it was raining so we dined inside. the have a nice setup for  outside dining."
2020-08-16,KerryD,3.0,"we disappointed by the limited menu plus the restaurant was out of swordfish even thought it was on the menu. also the number of side dishes was limited, ex: no mashed potatoes spinach. the quality of the food was average not we we have experienced on prior visits."
2020-08-16,chillybeans,3.0,"we had been looking forward to returning to legals after many months. this was unfortunately a disappointing experience. we understand the smaller menu due to less volume and are sympathetic. however, the a team was not working during our visit last sunday. we got the wrong appetizer, the correct one did appear quickly. i asked for no additional salt, my fries were covered in salt. when asked if i wanted a second drink, i said no, one appeared anyway. i repeated that i hadn’t ordered it, server seemed to think i did. when our bill arrived the second drink was still on there. the food was good, service far less. we miss the regular weekend servers who knew what they were doing."
2020-08-15,scott,3.0,"it was fine but just that and i expect more from legal. dinner for two and one drink between us was $80 which is fine. 
service was quite good. tall kid with a headband was attentive, intuitive, and asked the right questions. 

menu is limited and quality was average. again, we expect more from legal than average."
2020-08-14,jenj,3.0,"you know...it's covid so nothing is really great right now. they did a really good job of adhering to all the new guidelines and protocols. we wanted to sit outside, but we were seated inside and it was fine. food was meh. the menu is really bare bones-because well.. covid. i didn't love my scrod. it was bland. options for sides are limited-no potatoes of any kind. the kids liked their meals, and my friend thought her entree was good. our drinks were ok. the shining star was our waitress. she was fab.  the food service industry deserves a pat on the back no matter what right now..cause...covid."
2020-08-14,RLEJH,5.0,"we ate outside and thoroughly enjoyed it.  our server was friendly but also kept a good distance.  it was interesting to watch the excellent covid-19 precautions being taken for the safety of diners.  it was our first time eating out since the shut-down, and we felt safe and completely enjoyed our dinner.  the food, as usual, was excellent."
2020-08-08,CLS1,3.0,"the cost of dining out at legal seafood did not match the experience. we opted to eat on the patio to maximize our safety and minimize our potential exposure to covid 19. the patio in framingham was basically a couple of tables on the side of the building next to the parking lot. no attempt was made to create a barrier with plants or screens from the adjacent parking lot. even the waitress was telling us about patios in other restaurants that were superior. i would expect legal would step it up considering we paid $300 for four people. with that said, the service was great and the food was very good and up to the usual legal standards. i would not recommend the strawberry shortcake. my impression was the berries were previously frozen and the whipped cream was sprayed out of a can. definitely not worth the money."
2020-08-07,PeterBerzin,5.0,just a great experience and amazing food! we loved everything and will be going again
2020-08-07,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"because of covid 19, our experience was not as good as usual. the menu was quite limited and there was almost no one eating in the lounge area where we had dinner. the waiter was terrific, though, so we didn’t complain. legal seafoods is making an effort during the pandemic. we may just wait until the trout and squash are back before returning!"
2020-08-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,it was excellent as always
2020-08-06,WilliamH,4.0,"server maintained safe protocols. although, it was strange to see our waiter maintaining his distance between us and himself. selections on the menu were limited but food was well prepared."
2020-08-06,YSKim,5.0,"our server portia was very attentive, courteous and professional.  we had a wonderful dining experience."
2020-08-06,Mike,3.0,"it was our first visit, not a terrible experience but not what we expected. they brought over scallops that were undercooked and as a seafood restaurant that’s embarrassing"
2020-08-03,WaylandSteve,4.0,very good social distancing
2020-08-03,Nonr,1.0,"overpriced
food was mediocre 
smaller menu 
not what it used to be"
2020-08-01,PAGCHOC,4.0,"glad to see it reopened.  felt safe and the food was great as usual.  
the staff made you feel safe and comfortable."
2020-08-01,TripAdvisor,5.0,"hadn’t been to legal since covid shut down. they did a great job with table spacing etc. they have combined the lunch and dinner menu so is now  one all day menu. it’s not the full legal menu but there’s plenty of great stuff to choose from.

the margaritas are great! our tuna sashimi and fried shrimp were both excellent. service from taylor was fantastic.

they added a small seating area outside which looks like a good place to sit in fine weather.

legal rules!"
2020-08-01,MonicaW,3.0,plain scallops with white rice and fries not serve to the level expectedof legal sea food
2020-08-01,Alan,5.0,"legal sea food framingham is our favorite seafood restaurant in the area. as it is nearby, and the food is always excellent, we go there for special occasions and some saturdays.
my wife enjoys a salad with a side of crab meat and i enjoy the legal chowder and seafood casserole.
my wife also enjoys a glass of wine with dinner and i enjoy my coors lite.
we will continue to dine at legal in the future."
2020-07-31,JaniceM,4.0,"limited menu due to covid. the swordfish ($35) was a disappointing - thin and a little overdone.  the fried calamari 
appetizer was excellent. my husbands fried clams were also delicious."
2020-07-31,ElizabethV,5.0,we are outside on their new patio.  service was great and the food was delicious.
2020-07-30,Bessy,4.0,ate outside and felt very safe.
2020-07-30,PaulH,5.0,"we always love the food at legal seafoods.  our waiter, nick, was great.  it's a shame that too many people aren't eating out yet because of covid..  we wish that ls had more non-seafood entrees available so our son and daughter-in-law could join us for dinner more often.  never been a fan of the decorating - but the food is always great!"
2020-07-29,LynnM,4.0,"upon arriving all of the staff, including ourselves, had face masks on.  server was outstanding and the food very good.  felt safe since only a few tables were being occupied.  would go back again."
2020-07-29,OpenTable Diner,3.0,food was ok... ordered jasmine rice and got regular white rice with salmon....
2020-07-29,Cynthia,5.0,"finally back to our favorite restaurant, but just how different we’re things going to be?

it was terrific, they had all covid protocols in place, nothing seemed that different, but the changes were there!

my first cosmo since christmas, judy even remembered the extra cranberry juice!
the menu is smaller but all your favorites are still there, and totally delicious! the salmon and shrimp cooked to perfection, the strawberry shortcake was perfect on a steamy day.....
we enjoyed ourselves so much that a visit next week is not out of the question....

btw,legal is our only inside or outside dining attempt! why, because we trust manager,patrick snow, and of course
roger berkowitz to do this the correct way!
guys, your food is wonderful but so are your ethics.

thank you, our 31 anniversary was stellar."
2020-07-28,JAMJAM,3.0,"love legals & was so looking forward to them reopening in framingham.  during the time they were closed my husband & i really thought they would have done an update on the place (it’s needed it for years) nope... we sat in the lounge area at a table that the finish was all worn off.  the fish tank that broke years ago still there with a picture inside of it like a school of fish was swimming around., yea not so much.  i know covid has taken its toll but legals isn’t going anywhere unless they just don’t care anymore.  the food was yummy as always & service was great!!   even tho we live in framingham we will be going to chestnut hill when we decide to go back to legals."
2020-07-26,JohnM,2.0,"chowder was very good, crab cake was mediocre for 17.95, fried shrimp was very good but small portion for the price, fried clam appetizer portion was very good."
2020-07-25,TaraM,2.0,"everything has changed. the menu is significantly reduced. i understand that this is because of covid but honestly, i will not go back until more variety is incorporated back into the menu. prices have gone up as well so for what we had, it was absolutely not worth it. it is a very sad time. restaurants are making changes because of covid but if customers are not happy, then they are going to lose even more business. 
the calamari appetizer was very good. dinner (crab cakes and the seafood casserole) were just ok. seafood casserole was swimming in cheese and butter with only a few pieces of fish/shellfish. 
we used to love legal seafood. unfortunately, the prices don’t warrant another visit anytime soon."
2020-07-25,JohnS,5.0,great to come back to legal after a long wait. first time at this location and it was perfect
2020-07-25,BillS,5.0,"i would not consider eating seafood anywhere else in boston (this is our 33rd year eating at legals). the sides are terrific also. we always are served by serge (for decades) but he was out so portia served us, and she was great (we left her a $71 tip). we prefer oaky ca chards and there are several of our favorites on the wine list."
2020-07-24,PaulL,4.0,as always the food was excellent and the staff were attentive and courteous. they shortened the menu and many of their favorite dishes- both appetizers and main course were missing which was very disappointing
2020-07-24,Casper,5.0,"food excellent a bit pricey but best seafood unless your at the pier!
calamari tender, clams yummy!
in my5 top restaurants! i am
a foodie and i cook, so i know & appreciate good food!
i do not go to legal for ambience, but appreciate a quiet environment to dine, better for digestion!"
2020-03-14,ElizabethW,2.0,the service was terrible the food was adequate.  not worth the price.
2020-03-12,ANON,4.0,"classic boston area restaurant... excellent food and service with reliable delivery.  nonetheless, not the restaurant it was in the past."
2020-03-10,Bottomline222,4.0,cellibrating my wife birthday. she ordered the almond coated salmon and asked for no salt. i had the arts char. both were very good. legal is the consistent and the staff always excellent.
2020-03-09,stasju,5.0,"great food, good service ............................................

we go there frequently as i have a relative that has celiacs disease and legal does a great job with gf food"
2020-03-08,Onetwothreefour,5.0,food is always fantastic and always offers a variety of specials and favorites to please everyone in your party. we have dined here often and have never been disappointed.
2020-03-08,nothingbutnet,4.0,"server was very knowledgeable on menu and kindly offered the original smoked salmon app as one of us does not eat avocado.    this was much appreciated as the chestnut hill legals the week before was not as flexible.

all entrees were well received except one which was served cold and missing an item.  sat nite is quite busy and the restaurant was very full so not surprising result."
2020-03-07,md7716,3.0,"the starters and entrees were wonderful. the dessert was 50/50. the key lime pie wasn't great but the bread pudding was wonderful. unfortunately, slow service put a damper on the entire experience. we know the server was trying but we received a few ""the kitchen is backed up"" reports which is always a bit unfortunate. we usually have a great experience, so we'll chalk this one up to a less than stellar service night."
2020-03-07,MuckIsle,4.0,food was great - service did not meet expectations.
2020-03-07,sisjps1021,5.0,"super experience, can't wait to return. we love legal seafood restaurant and are delighted we found the one in framingham. by far, the best!"
2020-03-06,MelissaD,3.0,"my nutty salmon with mushroom raviolis was ghastly. the edges and top of the salmon were overdone and dry. the almonds on top were not crunchy; rather they were soggy and chewy. the measly three mushroom raviolis had been cooked at some point, but were dry with crunchy edges when our food arrived at the table. our server was so outstanding, and it was my husband’s birthday so i didn’t have the heart to complain."
2020-03-06,MikeNearBoston,2.0,"had the fried ""trio"" for lunch.  the breading and frying seemed right, but the fish was thin and somewhat chewy, the calamari was a little soggy, and the shrimp had an awful, off-putting aftertaste.  i'm not even sure what that aftertaste was.  the fries were ok.  the highlight of the meal was the warm dinner rolls with butter.  if i ever eat here again, i won't get anything fried."
2020-03-05,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we were unimpressed with this visit.  normally this chain does a nice job so it was surprising.  i had ordered a glass of wine at the bar and our table was ready before i had a chance to taste it.  i took one sniff of it and knew it was not a good wine.  the bartender had been rude and when i ordered the cabernet sauvignon he hadn’t even asked which one i wanted.  
i mentioned this to the server and he stated that he couldn’t do anything about it.  so there are four of us ordering drinks and dinner and he can’t fix one bad glass of wine??  he said the manager would have to fix it and i was game to have that person come over, but my colleagues were eager to smooth over the situation.  one of my colleagues offered to drink the bad wine.  we went on to order two much better bottles.  
service was very slow and the restaurant was not very busy.  the server messed up one of the dinner orders, although he was very apologetic and owned the mistake.  the manager came over and apologized as well and made the food order correct and removed it from the bill.
all that said, the food was excellent- as good as always.  i will chalk this up to one bad server but it has tainted my interest in returning to this location."
2020-03-05,Shassi,5.0,excellent experience for old friends to get together. food was great and service was exceptional. manager came by a couple of times and even provided a complementary desert to share. best experience at a legal .
2020-03-03,Ballou,5.0,"october 27, 2021 review. 
we returned to legal seafood framingham hoping our last visit was an anomaly. it was. we were treated to great service provided by judy and a much improved experience . it appears that the leadership is really listening to the reviews because this meal was excellent. two delicious crab salad rolls, french fries to die for, and generous serving of creamy coleslaw served hot and fresh. we were glad to have the legal experience we came to expect. back again soon!"
2020-03-01,82much,3.0,"we go to legals because my daughter has celiac disease and they handle her disease really well.  service started out slow but improved.  two different people brought me my one glass of wine and my daughter's salad came out twice, once with gf croutons and once without.  the actual restaurant looks a little dated but the food was all-around delicious and the service, at first lacking, became attentive. when we left we were all happy and looking forward to eating there again."
2020-03-01,gigi,5.0,"sergei was just terrific! competent, compassionate, and so gracious! it was a birthday party for grampa and we all shared a yummy dessert! thanks for everything! gold star for sergei"
2020-03-01,Cynthia,4.0,"all i can say about legal is that i miss you like crazy. 
when things are open again, all i want is a haircut and lunch at legal!"
2020-03-01,Okkpi00s,5.0,excellent service and service. i would recommend this place for anyone who likes traditional seafood dishes.
2020-03-01,Jane,5.0,"we had a great server and although the restaurant was jammed, the food arrived in a very reasonable time and was delicious!"
2020-03-01,LinMA,3.0,"passable food. bland and tasteless, everything was drowning in butter. butter was the only ""seasoning."" not even salt and pepper. jasmine rice should never have butter on it. why was no lemon served with the lobsters? c'mon, that's basic, nobody should have to ask for that.

the rolls were frozen and right out of the microwave. the hot wet towels after the lobsters were dry.

we haven't eaten here in years because the food was mediocre the last time we came in. and the manager had instructed a server to clean the banquettes in our section with cleaning liquid in a spray bottle and a towel and vacuum the floor while we were eating, and i had to argue with her to make the cleaning stop.

the framingham location is really the bottom of the berkowitz family barrel."
2020-03-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"leap day (february 29 legal’s had a $29 special. it was as advertised and more. great food, great company, great atmosphere. all around a good time."
2020-03-01,Berna,5.0,we had to wait a little while for our reservation but not too bad considering it was lobster special day! our server was very attentive and friendly.
2020-02-29,SuperDiner,5.0,"excellent service, delicious food especially fresh seafood. consistent quality of food. attentive to allergy needs in food offerings and preparation."
2020-02-29,melandjosdiner,5.0,we went for the leap year lobster special and it was fabulous.
2020-02-29,out2dine,4.0,it's definitely worth going to legal seafoods for their clam chowder and lobster. both are delicious!  the service was very good. making an opentable reservation is highly recommended as the wait times when we arrived were about 45 minutes. we were seated within 10 minutes and had a very nice table.
2020-02-29,Micky,5.0,"our server, sergi' , was excellent.  we did not feel rushed though there was a lobster special going on.  his help with wine selection was good, too.  legal is always accommodating with menu switches.  the only disappointment was that the polenta did not have enough jalapeno' peppers."
2020-02-29,RobertH,5.0,night out with my wife
2020-02-29,NancyG,5.0,"food service was excellent, very accommodating wait staff, food was very tasty, would highly recommend."
2020-02-29,KeithL,5.0,"my family and i brought my aunt, herlda senhouse to celebrate her 109th birthday. the server, whose name unfortunately escapes me was great and patrick, the gm comped her appetizer and my meal. he’s planned to come her meal, but due to a little planning mix-up, she’s had a snack before we got there. we all had a wonderful time."
2020-02-29,TIMS,5.0,we had a great family experience and happily recommend whether looking for a single seat at the bar or group at a table.
2020-02-29,TaraJ,5.0,my favorite - always consistently great food. high quality service and impeccably clean
2020-02-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great experience - will go again!
2020-02-29,johnz,5.0,our waiter was efficient and attentive.  menu provided an adequate number of choices for us.  food quality was very good.  very fresh seafood
2020-02-29,jsand,4.0,"we were attracted to the 2/29/2020 offer of 2 lobsters for $29.00 and the 2 chicken lobsters arrived with 2 sides- delicious fresh sautéed spinach and perfect cole slaw.  my husband ordered the fried scallops/shrimp/squid and it was a large order of perfectly non-greasy fried seafood.  he ordered a greek salad for us to share, but we brought it home instead with one of my lobsters.  our server was attentive in just the right way.  we'd go more often if the restaurant weren't so pricey!"
2020-02-23,DanielleS,3.0,the food wasn't as good as it usually is at legal seafood.
2020-02-22,SharonM,4.0,"our dinners and drinks were very enjoyable, our waiter - tyler, i believe - and the other staff did a great job, it is an attractive place and for the level of traffic, the noise wasn’t too bad. our reservation was for 6:30 on a saturday and it was sooo busy - too busy for us. ls needs to be bigger! we did enjoy our dinner but i’ll look for a place that’s not so busy next time."
2020-02-22,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the food was just ok and the front desk did not appear organized as the other half of our party was seated before us but never told us and we waited over 30 minutes before we determined they had already arrived.
2020-02-22,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal.  i always leave legal thinking about how much i enjoy coming here.  the chow is excellent, especially when you find your favorites and stick to them.  they are professional restaurateurs and will make things right in the odd chance that there's a hickup.  i loved my usual margarita to start (yes, it took me years to realize that they have great margaritas here).  house salad, seared tuna and steamed lobster... all perfect.  fantastic service, professional, friendly and efficient from serge, as always."
2020-02-22,ChristopherR,5.0,awesome seafood with great service. wait for a table was short
2020-02-17,OpenTable Diner,4.0,visit with famiky
2020-02-16,Lorenza,3.0,"i thought the meal was only mediocre.   for a place that specializes in fish, the lunch choices were too few and the fish i ordered only average.   if you are looking for something healthy, there are not enough options.   
why not fish with green vegetables?  i ended up ordering the scrod but it came with a huge pile of rice which tasted dried out ... under a heat lamp? ...and too much acorn squash.
no visual appeal.  lovely waitperson and good service."
2020-02-16,Almills3,4.0,legal is dependable for a great meal.
2020-02-16,Cgaar,5.0,"legal is always a good experience. we were on time for our reservation to celebrate my wife's birthday a day after valentine's day and we know to expect a crowd.  we had to wait a half hour for our table, so they comp'd our appetizers and it was a really nice gesture.  we know we can always count on fresh and good quality food at legal and even though it's pricey we come back.

they took the ramey cabernet off the wine list. i always enjoyed ordering a bottle of that and the price was reasonable. i miss it."
2020-02-15,Yummy,4.0,good experience
2020-02-15,OpenTable Diner,1.0,the food was terrible. small portions and expensive.
2020-02-15,FrancisT,4.0,almost perfect. food was great (although the veggies needed a minute longer - my wife had a very hard carrot!)
2020-02-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,valentine’s day
2020-02-14,jsands222,5.0,this was our 6th valentines dinner with the same friends. we look forward to it every year and have never been disappointed. both food and service are wonderful. sitting in the back room was very quiet and enjoyable.
2020-02-14,TomL,2.0,"we frequent legal seafood often. i purchase gift cards for family members during the holidays. our last meal there will more than likely be just that. at the very least, we won’t be returning to the framingham location. food quality was sub-par. baked stuffed lobster stuffing was soggy. my side of spinach came out more like a soup than a sauté. the crab stuffed lobster was full of shells. my wife and i were disappointed. i hate complaining to management. im not looking for a free meal. when i choose a restaurant i expect quality and for the food to be prepared with pride. customers shouldn’t have to complain. the product shouldn’t leave the kitchen if it isn’t perfect. we didn’t experience that on our last visit."
2020-02-13,PaulaB,5.0,three of us. we all ordered swordfish and it was excellent.
2020-02-13,SharonW,4.0,food was delicious and very fresh. our waiter knowledgeable and friendly.
2020-02-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"in 27 years, i have dined at legals over 100 times and i have never had a bad meal or experience. this is the only restaurant that i can practically guarantee a great experience. no doubt."
2020-02-12,NanM,5.0,delicious!
2020-02-09,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"seemed like something was off with the service this evening - it was so slow! this was our first time at this location, and it was nothing like the attentive service and great food we’ve had at other locations."
2020-02-09,Chris,5.0,"we had lunch here today. i had a shrimp quesadilla that was really good - just a hint of spiciness, but not enough to overpower the shrimp. my wife had a crab cake & my son had salad with tuna. both were very happy with their meals. service was good. we were happy with the lunch process, not too expensive."
2020-02-07,SeaOtter,5.0,gluten free deep fried calamari?!?! yes please! very gluten friendly and delicious!!!!
2020-02-06,BobC,3.0,unfortunately over the years i have seen legal lose some of its cachet.  this last visit revealed a menu that was pretty lacking in interesting new options.  i ordered grilled trout which tasted okay but was plopped on a big plate with a side of uninspiring mashed potatoes.  the presentation was lacking in finesse for sure.  flight of wines i had was pedestrian in flavor.  other party members felt their meals were okay but again the presentation was not great.  just lots of food dumped on a plate.  the server was not quick to clear extra plates and as a result the table was cluttered with used dishes and glasses.  server was polite and did respond to needs when asked.  hate to say i would not recommend but will give it another try at some point.
2020-02-06,Vegas,2.0,"sadly, we had a less than sparkling experience on wednesday night. our waitress, obviously brand new and undertrained ruined our dining experience."
2020-02-05,AmberH,5.0,our waitress kelly was absolutely amazing! she is a credit to legal seafoods!
2020-02-05,joanned,5.0,"very accommodating to special food requests. service was very nice, and a little slow for lunch."
2020-02-02,Marc,4.0,"we never have a bad meal at legal sea foods. i had a craving for a fisherman's platter and the one i had was outstanding. with so much fried food, it could end up being heavy but it wasn't. it had a good mix of different kinds of seafood, perfectly breaded and fried. my wife had the grilled assortment which also excellent. our waitress was fantastic and always on top of whatever we needed."
2020-02-01,Cynthia,5.0,"serge was our waiter again and remembered everything we loved. we played with his mind as the new lunch menu is terrific. i urge everyone to try the new smoked haddock 
chowder- old fashion and still heavenly.
thank you legal, you’re our favorite.

2020-01-31,DebbiF,4.0,"legal seafoods seems to be going downhill a bit.  seafood is the best part, but the menu needs refreshing.  service was okay.  dessert was so so."
2020-01-31,andyrudy,5.0,"seafood casserole was outstanding, hot and delicious, the others with me said theirs was great too."
2020-01-26,DonnaG,5.0,when i arrived at the restaurant said i had a reservation the host looked at the screen said my name and was ready to seat me. due to me having my autistic child with me i needed to be placed in a low traffic area and after a 5min wait we were seated. our meals came out and one wasn’t the way it was ordered (me not knowing)but the correct one came right out with the rest of the meals and they gave me the wrong one to take home. from the time i arrived to the time i left like always had a very pleasant experience. i try to make the 80 mile one way trip at least twice a year.
2020-01-26,lauraD,3.0,drinks for five very slow to be brought to us. though most  of our party enjoyed their meals my clam chowder was very salty and my dressed salad came to me soggy.  lunch menu prices varied from moderate to overpriced. standard bloody mary and wine by the glass very expensive.
2020-01-25,RickO,5.0,"first time to one of this chains- outposts.
outstanding experience; right on time with our reservation. our server was extremely helpful, friendly, patient in answering questions about menu items & seafood specials of the day. he also made sure the food & service met expectations. fresh food & fair portion size.  when dessert  took a bit longer than expected- the waiter took the initiative & made complimentary. 
would return to this or other locations without hesitation"

food was mediocre 

not usual for legals"
2020-01-21,DMJ13,4.0,we sat in the bar and it smelled kinda funky. our waiter seemed like he didn’t want to be there. other then this the food was great and the overall experience was positive
2020-01-20,MarceloC,4.0,"waiter was very clingy, requested shrimp just grilled with no butter or oil and got shrimp with some oil."
2020-01-20,JohnN,4.0,business dinner. my swordfish dinner wad disappointing.
2020-01-18,MARGARETE,5.0,we had a wonderful date night! the food was wonderful and our server was great however one of the others who came and brought water and bread was a little gruff.  overall will definitely go back!
2020-01-18,Alan,4.0,"got cioppino which i often get at legals. good amount of muscles, a few clams, lots of calamari, 3 shrimp but only 2 scallops and small lobster claw. my issue is the don’t put in enough fish. this has happened multiple times and i may have to find a different dish or try another place."
2020-01-16,girlfriend,3.0,visiting from california. meals were good but not of the same quality as we remember a few years back. service was slow and wait person not very friendly.
2020-01-16,Foodfanatic1,3.0,"fish and chips good. 
not a fan of cole slaw.  kind of bitter. needs a touch sweetness. 
crab cake ok but nothing compared to maryland area. for the price i hope crab is not from se asia.  
desserts were very bad choc pudding cake dry and bitter. inedible.  key lime crust tasted very old and stale and filling dry.  go next door to burtons.  they bake it fresh daily and it’s moist with fresh graham cracker crispy crust
you need to step it up. gone downhill"
2020-01-15,roc1,3.0,just ok. needs an update. chestnut hill far better
2020-01-11,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"we have been customer of legal seafood for45 years.  our experience in the past with legal has been wonderful and was the reason we selected it for my family to celebrate my wife’s birthday. 

from the appetizers to the main course, drinks and dessert it was a miserable experience and a profound disappointment.  all seven of us had  problems with our entree.  those were made up of overcooked tuna and swordfish, tasteless clams and undercooked vegetables accompanied by a watered down bloody mary. not worth wasting an evening and $400+. 

we left with the feeling we hadn’t really celebrated anything. 

i have never written to criticize a restaurant before but the disappointment of the once wonderful restaurant that legal used to be has compelled me to use open table as a means to vent all of this."
2020-01-11,LucyB,5.0,"server was courteous . food was delicious. the place was more noisy than i like, but not so that i would not return."
2020-01-11,JoissC,5.0,the server and manager went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience! we’re definitely going back !
2020-01-10,Ballou,5.0,sergei was exceptional as always!
2020-01-07,Ballou,5.0,tom did a excellent job waiting on us. i enjoyed the nutty salmon dinner from the dinner menu and my wife has salmon from the luncheon menu we both enjoyed a boston cream pie dessert. tom did a wonderful job meeting our needs and will be back very soon.
2020-01-07,FavoritePlace,5.0,"great variety of lunches
great seafood
something for every palate and diet"
2020-01-06,Blondie,3.0,"the greens in my greek salad was filled with stalks without leaves.  i brought it to the attention of my server,  who in turn brought it to the attention of the kitchen.  i was told that they buy the greens pre-cut  and that they would bring it to the attention of the vendor.  i was offered a free dessert.  i don't eat dessert.  i would expect that the kitchen would check the quality of all food before it is used and/or served.  this was not my usual legal seafood experience.  very disappointing!"
2020-01-05,DND2,4.0,"our waiter was wonderful -oscar i believe was his name.
drinks were so good - i had flight one of white wines and my husband had a cranberry crush- he loved it! oysters were fresh and yummy and the bang bang cauliflower was excellent. 
the only area that could use improvement is the smell - it was faint but noticeable - a distinct sour smell- think old bathroom .... could be where we sat in the lounge .. close to kitchen, idk but hopefully just a one time thing."
2020-01-05,ScottA,2.0,sat at bar and service not up to legal standard. menu has become pretty dull over the years

manager said we can request tom on our future visits and we will 
thank you tom"
2020-01-01,Nancym,5.0,"always high quality seafood, perfectly prepared.  menu shifts occasionally as interesting new items are added.  this was the first time i tried the smoked salmon avocado toast; it's great!  service is attentive and friendly.  the prices aren't cheap but it's well worth the cost for the quality of the ingredients and the preparation.  you can pay less elsewhere and get something inferior; you can pay more at places that try to portray themselves as ""gourmet"" and not get a better meal.  so stick with the pros who do seafood right every time."
2020-01-01,K4Outsiders,5.0,food was excellent
2020-01-01,davidh,4.0,"food quality seemed a little off from previous visits.  fish was a little under cooked, the claim chowder, seemed to be a little crunchy maybe a some small pieces of shell.  service was good otherwise"
2020-01-01,TonyL,4.0,"nice new year celebration. the night started at bar, good service, delicious vodka drinks, good conversation with others at bar. after being seated at our reserved table for 8:30 ( 15 min late) our attentive waiter did a nice job of handling our food service. food was excellent.  my wife and i enjoyed the night."

2019-12-31,southpaw,5.0,"excellent waitress!  she didn’t rush us which was great. she was pleasant and helpful and the food was outstanding!
legal is the only restaurant that i know of where i can get excellent gluten free seafood.   it is unusual  to have the  ability to get fried clams and calamari that are gluten free at any seafood restaurant within a 100 mile radius of where i live so i appreciate the opportunity to dine comfortably at legal and enjoy such wonderful food (and drink)"
2019-12-31,StatLady,5.0,"the lunch was delicious and served exactly as ordered.

thank you!"
2019-12-31,tadamass,4.0,"my family has been going to legal since 1970.  we were so surprised at the changes to recipes like ri calamari. not the same with marinara sauce and not as good.  my 92 y o mother always got the crab cake lunch and was very disappointed with the meal.  so sad.  the lobster ravioli looked great.
not sure i want to try again. the calamari was a go to."

2019-12-26,JohnE,5.0,"we eat here periodically because we love it. the prices keep us from coming more often. but, we had a gift card and figured we'd go. my wife had the cioppino which she loved. even took the remaining sauce home to try and replicate it. i had the grilled seafood assortment which came with 4 grilled scallops, 4 grilled shrimp and a piece of grilled tuna, grilled salmon and grilled swordfish. what more could you ask for. maybe we should consider it more ;-)"
2019-12-26,AnnE,3.0,everything was pretty good. disappointed fries were cold. they were redone and then almost burnt. my husband's ice-cream with bananas foster was like soup. i expected better on those two things.
2019-12-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"our flight landed early and we were accommodated an hour earlier than our reservation time, despite being fully booked on christmas day. the service was excellent, cocktails were amazing (mai tai is actually better than in hawaii, less sweet, more alcohol) and seafood was fresh and delicious."
2019-12-25,sueG,4.0,we were there on christmas and the usual delicious food was off.  the salad was different than us usual and e haddock on top had the skin on.  my sons swordfish has hardly any salsa w it.   i normally love legal’s and this time they just missed the mark.
2019-12-25,ThomasA,5.0,"what can i say? it's just a great restaurant to eat. excellent food, service and ambiance. we will definitely go there again"

2019-12-24,NatickDiner,4.0,we are regulars at legal. have done the christmas eve dinner for nearly 25 years.  it was a treat for my mother in law until her passing.  my wife and i continue in her honor. food was good just not up too legal standards. just a bit overcooked.  something just missing. service was great.
2019-12-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,wonderful service and excellent food 😁
2019-12-24,irepra,4.0,"we were at legal for christmas eve. my son had lobster which was a winner. we had the nutty salmon which is always good. the wine was so so. prices are high. the house salad is now 10.00, but knowing this, i would recommend them."

2019-11-29,Michaeldisappointed,1.0,we didn't stay.  the menu selection was limited and prices expensive!  what i ordered for $17.95 at the boston legal sea foods was $32.95 at the framingham legal sea foods!  very disappointing...we won't be back!

we loved our thanksgiving dinner."
2019-11-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,delicious food and great service.
2019-11-28,Monkeemom,3.0,"we were somewhat disappointed this year that the restaurant seemed to have decided to lower customer experiences.  our server was excellent and we received an excellent services.  it was the small things like no table cloths, cheaper dinner bread (almost like the ones you would get at grocery store), coffee, etc.  we have gone to this particular restaurant every thanksgiving day for the last several years and never thought about going elsewhere, we will probably look into other restaurant next year.  we wanted our thanksgiving dinner special but it ended up as a regular meal at a dinner kind of experience with $170 for three which is not really worth it."
2019-11-27,jjmjjj,4.0,"we loved our food.  our server was fine but a bit under the weather and awfully busy.  we love the delicious seafood we get at legal's and will keep coming despite the server being just ""okay""."

2019-11-23,mom2tristan,3.0,"legal fish is really always reliable. tonight was no exception. but everything else - meh. 

we started with caesar salads. the lettuce was not terribly fresh. the dressing was too salty. meh. 

i had the salmon and risotto special. the salmon was perfect. literally perfect. the risotto was awful. mushy, flavorless, a pale yellow, truly not worth eating. my husband had the arctic char which was very good though a bit salty. he enjoyed his side dishes. the pumpkin cheesecake was fine. not great, not bad. 

the service was lovely. 

it’s a shame the quality control didn’t extend beyond the fish tonight. alas..."

2019-11-02,LuWest,3.0,food was very good as always. calamari appetizer and jasmine shrimp meal were quite good. ambiance at this location has declined and for the price not a good value. it was friday night and not crowded and a dull energy. there was an odor in the restaurant/ bar area; musty or possibly sewage odor.
2019-10-31,TonyA,3.0,we've been going to legal for quite a few years for our wedding anniversary. the reservation was made online and i also called ahead to confirm they knew it was for a wedding anniversary and requested a nice setting. when we arrived the host didn't seem to have any idea about it being an anniversary.  this was the reason for my disappointment.
2019-10-30,SarahC,4.0,we ate in the side room which i like but still too noisy for my taste
2019-10-29,ChrisM,4.0,"solid seafood experience as one should expect from this staple.  we celebrated mother-in-law's birthday, and the entire staff could not have been nicer.  our waitress was fantastic in terms of her attentiveness and recommendations."

2019-10-27,SusanD,2.0,"the service and dinning experience was very disappointing. we had to ask for bread, we were given no bread plates and we had to ask for water. the seaweed salad was brown in color and unappealing. the only thing that saved the night was the maple bread pudding dessert which was excellent."
2019-10-26,SeafoodMW,4.0,"very rich food - high fat carb content in main entrees. service excellent. atmosphere good. seated according to reservation time. ordered scotch - stingy amount.

chocolate covered ice cream- don’t get chocolate was like cheap easter bunny kind. 

entrees good but rich in fat butter and portion for price also lacking. overall overpriced."
2019-10-26,contentdiner,5.0,we got seated promptly. waitstaff great
2019-10-26,Kimberly,5.0,i definitely would return. the baked stuffed shrimp was amazing. service was well-timed and friendly.
2019-10-25,JuliaW,5.0,"we find that legal seafood is a great restaurant for the food, service, etc  and they  treat you nicely if you have children in your party.  they have a kids menu with activities and bring the cups with appropriate tops and genuinely welcome you.  it is a great restaurant to have a family gathering where you want a nice meal but also want it to be kid friendly."
2019-10-25,PaulG,5.0,"great, attentive service!  great food!  we just flew in from denver and were excited to spend time with relatives we haven’t seen for a while!  didn’t feel rushed! had a lot of fun!"
2019-10-24,chefhelen,5.0,"the food was great but the server couldn’t keep up and knew nothing about the wine he was selling.  i understand that you may not drink but we can read the menu descriptions, you don’t need to read them to us.  was loud but the food was great,"
2019-10-23,Ballou,5.0,thanks to pat for a great table! we are always thrilled to have judy as our server! judy offered a great new dish-scallops over polenta! i enjoyed my favorite nutty salmon and added a side of butternut squash and cranberries. we topped off our early dinner with boston cream pie. you cannot go wrong at legal!
2019-10-22,diner,4.0,good for conversation. the level of staff attention was ideal. good food and still the best shrimp cocktail i’ve had anywhere.

2019-10-19,Uthrac,5.0,"three of us and an infant were sat on time at our reserved 7:30 pm saturday evening time. staff provided a high chair that we could set our carrier on. moderate noise all around, but baby slept through it and we had no trouble hearing the conversation at our central table. waiter was attentive; refills prompt. food was delicious - salmon, seafood combo, and crab cake combo. great dining experience."
2019-10-19,birthdayboy,4.0,"had to send an order back because spicy sauce was put on tuna when i made a point of saying ""no sauce.""  otherwise, everything was fine."
2019-10-17,hockeyfan,3.0,"seems the food has changed. both our meals tasted “cheaper” than the last time we were there. cheaper cuts of meat, seafood not prepared to the quality standards of the past. smaller menu with several favorite options gone. seems legal is trying to save money by offering a lower quality product."
2019-10-17,KevinD93,5.0,as always it was a great experience.
2019-10-16,Cheryl,5.0,"framingham's legal sea foods still leads the way - we had my daughter and her friend visiting from san francisco - and they were both enthralled and delighted with their meals.

not to be outdone, my wife and i, as usual, truly enjoyed our own meals.  we are never disappointed -
the food, the service, the ambience,- and the closeness to our home delight us each and every time."
2019-10-15,AndreaH,2.0,"i’ve been to several legal seafood locations and this one was unfortunately, the worse. food lacked flavor, service left something to be desired."
2019-10-14,Terri,4.0,excellent meal and service.
2019-10-13,catttpurrr,3.0,"we had a reservation and got seated right away.   it didn’t take long for our waitress to come over and take our order.   we ordered red wine.   it was good but was room temperature/almost warm.  it needs just a slight chill to bring out the flavors.  the first fish i ordered was out at 7:30 pm.  so we both ordered the tuna steak, which was prepared perfect.   i was very excited that it came with a side of brussels sprouts but for some reason it came out with sautéed spinach with no explanation.    the jalapeño polenta was yummy.  
our waitress was attentive until our food came out.   then we only saw her when she quickly handed us the bill, which was another tables.   we were waiting for her to come back to cork our wine to take home but she never did. i’m guessing she left for the night.  we flagged down another waitress, who was very pleasant and helpful with it.   
the sound level was very high but i know to expect that there.   i wish some music would be playing in the background and that there would be candles on the table for a little better ambiance.  
food was good but overall could use some improvement.   i expect more for the prices they charge at legal seafoods."
2019-10-12,sueO775,3.0,the food was excellent..better than it has been.  the service was poor...perhaps too few servers
2019-10-12,sibud,2.0,the waiter was rude. never told us the specials. ignored us because we didn’t order everyday once. i will not return. stop trying to move tables instead of letting people enjoy their nite out
2019-10-08,Indy,3.0,food is pretty good but wait time for dishes to arrive is high
2019-10-08,MarcS,5.0,great fish (and chicken).  service is always knowledgeable and friendly.  thanks
2019-10-07,GregoryM,5.0,"good service, food was fine, atmosphere was very good.  the only complaint was the lack of parking to this restaurant."
2019-10-07,SandyB,5.0,food and service were very good
2019-10-07,BillH,3.0,food was average for lunch and had a limited menu.
2019-10-05,ChartHouse,4.0,the good news for legals was it was extremely busy at 6pm on a saturday evening.  the bad news for us is that the service was a bit slow especially getting drinks throughout the evening.  seems as though the bar couldn't keep up.  the menu has changed slightly...seafood was excellent as always but they decided to change the seaweed salad recipe...it tasted like dirt.  seriously...not a good change.  i hope they remove it from the menu as it's totally inedible.  had i known i would have chosen another side that i could have eaten.  still a great restaurant and the wait staff can only do so much...perhaps they should hire another bartender to keep up with the drink orders on weekends?
2019-10-05,CharlesS,5.0,"outstandingly fresh seafood, outstanding wait-staff, and nice atmosphere ... not too ""noisy""!"
2019-09-29,herb,3.0,wine prices for just a glass are getting too high.  $11 and up
2019-09-28,BigDave,4.0,our waiter wasn’t as attentive as he should have been. had to ask for more bread vs the waiter next to our table asked if they wanted more bread or another drink. matthew was too busy but it didn’t seem like he wanted to connect with us
2019-09-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"service was terrific, food good but way pricey."
2019-09-26,Sammie,5.0,the fish -as always -was phenomenal and perfectly done - especially the grilled fish and shrimp.. the key lime pie ranks as one of the best we’ve had - and we sample across the country.

2019-09-25,Newtonfoodie,4.0,"you can always rely on legal for a consistently good  meal. even though it was oyster fest, a lot of the advertised oysters were not available, which was disappointing."
2019-09-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great experience for my wife’s birthday.  everyone loved it
2019-09-21,tron781,3.0,"hostess seemed stoned

waiter apologized, he was very nice and attentive. another waiter we've had in the past stopped and said hello, he asked if we need anything

mussels had cilantro on them for some bizarre reason

seafood casserole stuffing was a tad overcooked but everything was still great"
2019-09-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,consistently excellent! my favorite place for swordfish by far. the service is always great. this place never disappoints.
2019-09-16,foodie4boston,3.0,"the waiter did not see a full glass of wine and knocked it over with the oyster tray spilling all of the wine on my jacket and shirt. all i got are two extra napkins, no offer to pick up the tap for dry cleaning or even replacing the glass of wine they spilled on me."
2019-09-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great service from the time we checked in until we paid our bill. excellent food and the noise level was perfect ,  given that we wanted to be able to converse."
2019-09-14,MarceloC,3.0,"this is one of our favorite restaurants....  but this time the food wasn’t great, my rainbow trout was very dry, the brown rice wasn’t as flavorful
as it normally is, kind of bland and they are getting rid of seaweed salad and replacing it with kelp which is not a pleasant flavor!  i wish they would just stick with what they do best and not change things, we definitely won’t be going back as frequently as we go."
2019-09-13,Retiredteacher,5.0,excellent as usual.  we always get a consistent wonderful meal.  very relaxing atmosphere.
2019-09-11,JonS,5.0,great meal as always!
2019-09-11,marjo,3.0,"been here many many times. usually very good food and service. this time not so good. waited 1/2 hour for appetizers, asked manager to check and he said first time my oysters legal were burned and had to be redone! what if i didn’t flag him down? 
then main courses came - trout for both of us was the thinnest we have ever seen at legal - impossible to  separate meat from skin. perhaps not trout season, perhaps should not be on menu. 
there were many new waiters, perhaps new kitchen help also?
going to boston legal next, hope things  haven’t changed there."
2019-09-11,GoodfoodAwesomeService,4.0,"great food - the baked oysters and anna's cod were awesome.  cooked just right and the wiater ""serge"" was unbelievably attentive and helpful."
2019-09-11,Rigby1,1.0,"farmed salmon, over cooked vegetable & heavily sauced food. not good!"
2019-09-11,Stephanie,3.0,the lobster roll was the most expensive lobster roll (at $32) for the size.  not at all anything special- the most expensive one around including nice restaurants in nantucket and at capital grille!  you need to reprice this or up the size.
2019-09-08,Ellens,5.0,always count on great food at legals. everything was delicious
2019-09-06,TripAdvisor,5.0,another superb visit to legal.  tonight we stopped by the bar area and enjoyed the clam chowder and shrimp cocktails... along with margaritas and sonoma cutrer chard.  so good!
2019-09-04,MROB,4.0,food was solid but decor or really tired. time for a refresh
2019-09-03,Bottomline222,3.0,"as a long time visitor to legal framingham we have see ups and downs when we dine at this location. today was one of those downs.

my wife regularly orders trout prepared provençal style. unfortunately the kitchen has forgotten how to make it. what arrive was a pan fried trout with a side dish of sautéed spinach, grape tomatoes, and mushrooms. it would have at least looked like provençal style if the served it on top of the trout. disappointing.

we ordered a side of seaweed salad only to find that legal had changed to a healthier version from maine. looked and tastes nothing like a japanese seaweed salad. we sent it back.

thai style calamari- fried almost no thai sauce or taste. eatable but that’s about all."
2019-09-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,so easy to eat there with celiac!
2019-08-31,MichaelV,5.0,very good dinner and service at the natick legal sea foods.
2019-08-31,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the fried scallops with french fries and cole slaw were excellent.  the scallops were sweet and perfectly cooked.  the fries did not have those pesky peels, and the cole slaw was crisp and fresh.  our waitress went out of her way to please us.  the house salad was not remarkable, but the key lime pie was scrumptious."

2019-08-29,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal... a classic.  i love dining at legal seafoods... great chow, service.... professional attitude.  loved my shrimp cocktail, blackened halibut, sonoma cutrer chardonnay.  great service."
2019-08-29,jsand,4.0,"everything was the classical legal delicious flavor.  we were surprised when the bowl of their famous clam chowder was served.  it looked like what the cup of soup used to look like.  too expensive for the quantity, despite the quality.  our server was very friendly, but a little forgetful about who ordered what. she did offer us the ice cream bonbons to celebrate a birthday.  very generous.   we often come to legal when my brother-in-law is in town, but the prices have risen so much that we may not be able to come any more."
2019-08-28,Patk,3.0,"it was not as good as usual. the server seemed a bit lazy. we asked to split a house salad with parmesan dressing. one half came with the correct dressing while the other appeared to have none at all. but they had dressed it with a vinaigrette which was pooled at the bottom and undiscovered until eaten. she did not offer to replace it or refund the cost. she also never re-filled our water glasses. the lemon caper grey sole had very little sauce and the roasted carrots were hard but had a weird sauce. prices were high as ever, though."
2019-08-27,SandyB,4.0,1 meal was made incorrectly.  they replaced it.
2019-08-26,LarryA,5.0,i am a regular at both framingham and braintree and it is my favorite restaurant.

2019-08-25,Mitch,4.0,"we go to legal on a regular basis. food was great. service was very good. i had the grilled assortment which was a piece of salmon, swordfish and tuna together with 4 grilled shrimp and several scallops. delicious and a great value."
2019-08-24,TimM,5.0,"great service, and food but was loud."
2019-08-24,BJup,4.0,"as we have found for years, the food was excellent. our server was very attentive as well.
but when we first came in for our 7 pm reservation we were taken to a table for 2 that was very unattractively located, despite other open tables.
i told the young hostess who presented us to that table that it was “a very creepy table” and i would prefer to be seated elsewhere. she found us a much better table for two.
but i don’t understand why she attempted to seat us at that first table to begin with, considering that we arrived on time for our reservation and the restaurant appeard to be much less busy than usual."
2019-08-24,HenryM,4.0,"the usual excellent legal seafood--especially grilled salmon. fresh salads. attentive wait-staff, but not intrusive. noise level low for legal on a sat. evening, probably because clientele was away on vacation. only caveat: midtown nyc prices; really impossible to  receive bill of less than $100 (for 2, 1 glass of wine each)."
2019-08-24,SandyB,5.0,nelson our waiter was very attentive to our needs
2019-08-22,JenR,4.0,the food was wonderful.  the staff was very attentive and helpful.  the atmosphere was stylish and attractive.
2019-08-22,eljay,5.0,"the food was quite good (everyone agreed!), but it was the service and kindnesses shown all around that made it a great day. we were a small group, celebrating a birthday and had in our party someone with handicaps. hostess and  server were both so attentive and anticipatory of needs. server's great sense of humor also went a long way with us."
2019-08-21,MarilynT,5.0,be prepared for a noisy restaurant.  the waiter had too many tables to take care of.  we had to beg for water.  food was excellent

2019-08-19,lilli,5.0,"lovely time as always at legal. quiet, delicious lunch of fish tacos, the best anywhere!"
2019-08-18,OpenTable Diner,2.0,char and salmon were overcooked.  at least the took the char off the bill.
2019-08-18,Jumeau,5.0,"although we had to change our reservation at least 4 times we were courteously seated with no fuss when we finally arrived. our server was very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  i didn’t have to ask for my water or coffee to be refilled.  also re: coffee: it was outstanding. 
one other comment about the food: french fries were served with our meals and for the prices we were charged ($32 for a lobster roll) they were lackluster.  you need to bring your french fries up to the high & distinctive standards of your other menu items.  
otherwise it was another memorable, relaxing and enjoyable meal at legals, a family favorite.  we’ll be back soon!"
2019-08-17,KymT,3.0,"the waitress, elizabeth, was terrific. the kitchen sent out the entrees before the appetizer. she was apologetic and comped the dessert."
2019-08-17,JoshC,5.0,this might have been one of the best legal visits i've had. great service and great food. we weren't made to feel at all rushed. a+ i don't recall our server's name but he's the tall gent who would remind you of seth macfarlane. great job.
2019-08-16,RobertS,1.0,"frankly this is the first time i've left legal seafood after a meal totally disappointed. the fried fisherman's platter was dulled by old, used oil which really surprised me because usually it's fresh and tasty. for $31 it was way below par and very expensive waste of money. the french fries were equally lacking in freshness and taste. even the coffee we ordered was so poor neither my wife nor i bothered drinking it. we left very disappointed and probably will not have another meal t legal seafood again."
2019-08-16,StatLady,3.0,during our last two visits my entree has not been properly cooked to my request even after sending it back. i would prefer an entree i can eat rather than reimbursement or whatever. the kitchen is poor compared to 6 months or more ago!
2019-08-15,OpenTable Diner,4.0,had a nice meal and the service was great
2019-08-15,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was very accommodating, professional and friendly as always.  all our orders were prepared to our exact request and delivered to us timely.  she made our dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  judith is the best!!!!"
2019-08-13,RaquelV,3.0,"we always come to legal (either burlington or framingham) for birthdays and other special family occasions. there is something here for everyone and the ambiance is appropriate for young and old alike. this trip wasn’t one of our best. our server was outstanding and on the ball. we all ordered our favorite dishes, including two of us with dinner portions of the tuna sashimi *with no wasabi*. an hour after we were seated the manager came to our table to apologize that things were running behind. she made a big point of saying that they were taking care to put “no wasabi cream” on our sashimi. our server then came by to check and make sure the manager had stopped by the table. the food came out less than ten minutes later with no wasabi on the sashimi, but the other two dishes extremely over cooked. trout was tough and dried out and the salmon that i had ordered medium rare was well done at best. i did point this out to the server who offered to have them cook me new salmon, which i declined as we were more than half way through our meal and had already been waiting so long. she then offered me a second glass of wine which i declined since i was the driver. they comped my meal in the end and the manager brought bon bons at the end of the meal as an apology. in all, it felt as though our server noted an error in the plating of sashimi (probably had wasabi cream on it as this happens often, even when we request it to be held) and had them fix it before the food got to the table, bravo to her! not so happy with whomever kept my fish warm to the point of it being well done. the manager certainly made up for the errors but probably would have been better off telling us what happened from the beginning (she only ever acknowledged that they were “running behind”) we understand that errors happen in a busy kitchen and as i said, the server was on the ball and caught it before it got to us. being more open would have left us all happier in the end. will still go back."

2019-08-10,Chris,5.0,"as always at legal sea foods, our meals were excellent. i had the crab cake combo - the crab cake had lots of crab and was very tasty. my wife & son had the chef's grilled combo and my daughter had the arctic char. all were every happy with what they got. my wife is a bit picky about how her food is cooked and everyone was cooked just as she requested. the service was friendly & attentive."
2019-08-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,our server matthew was amazing! we sat at a booth near the bar and celebrated my husband's birthday. matthew even sang him happy birthday! thank you! oh.... and stuffed shrimp! always amazing
2019-08-08,TripAdvisor,5.0,"sat at one of the tables in the bar area tonight... we like to sit here once in a while.  house salad w/peppercorn dressing, lite clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp w/mashed.  a few drinks and we were all set.  another excellent meal!"

2019-08-04,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is an institution.  i've been frequenting their various locations for over 40 years... always great.  this location, being in framingham, makes it perhaps the top spot in the area.  tonight, lite clam chowder, house salad w/peppercorn dressing, shrimp cocktail, blackened halibut, ice cream bon bons for dessert.  consistently excellent."

2019-08-03,karenb,3.0,"we were a party of 12, and the way we were seated, the server had to ask the people on one side of the table to pass their plates, wine glasses, etc. for clearing and for serving our food.  personally, i like to be waited on.  assisting the waiter with their job is not my job as a patron.  also, when our plates were being cleared, plates with one person's food were piled on top of the next person's plate in front of them, and then a third, and then picked up.  that was not appropriate in my opinion - to have other people's dirty plates and remaining food piled one on top of the other in front of other people.  when dessert and coffee were being offered it was done from one end of the table, but those of us at the other end were not also addressed, and we had to ask to have coffee for those on the other end. when the coffee was delivered, they did not know who was supposed to get what coffee, and just called out ""who had a cappucino,"" etc.  so, service was a b- at best this time around.  food didn't wow anyone, but was consistent for legal's, i guess.  won't go back with a large party.  the bill with tip was well over $700."
2019-08-02,Rubob,5.0,"table ready when we arrived. excellent drinks, delightful server, fabulous, interesting, well prepared food!"
2019-08-02,Debbie,2.0,"waiter was not very friendly and ignored us after we complained about drinks.   bartender that night could not make good drink.  we ended up getting wine since we knew they couldn't screw that up.    food was good though.   legal sea foods is usually one of our favorite places, but not that night."
2019-08-02,janisl,5.0,superb preparation of high quality fresh fish. not as many fish varieties as i hoped. too many shellfish without regular fish varieties. side dishes appeared to have spicy combinations but i was able to sub with non spicy sides.
2019-08-01,flowerlady,5.0,"three of us enjoyed our meal as usual.  we arrived at 3 pm, so it was quiet.  the waitperson was attentive without being intrusive.  i think at least some of the waitstaff have learned not to say ""perfect!"" with each choice that is made, and i appreciate that.  i love the cioppino, but now have to request an accompaniment of rice, which used to come with the entree.  perhaps most diners didn't eat the rice, but i mix mine with the broth that remains after i have eaten my fill, than take it home for a delicious lunch (the rice soaks up the broth)."
2019-07-31,NYTaster,3.0,kayla was a fantastic waitress.  her recommendations and knowledge of the menu was exceptional.  will come back next time i'm in the area.
2019-07-29,OpenTable Diner,3.0,food was subpar. service was even worse. legal isn’t what it used to be.

2019-07-15,Ellen,5.0,excellent food - martinis - service and gluten-free offerings.  it's one of the few restaurants in the area where people with true gluten allergies can eat just about everything without a worry in the world! one of my favorite restaurants!
2019-07-13,RachelG,5.0,"excellent service from start to finish. great menu and all of our food was delicious. especially appreciate a reasonable quality and good value wine menu. they noted the online request for a quieter spot and were able to honor that. noticed that, as the place emptied out around the 9pm mark that they don't play music over the sound of conversations, which we really appreciate as too many restaurants do that and it makes conversation for someone with any hearing loss really challenging and unpleasant - so thank you! and a lovely touch to bring out a candle with our desserts which shows attention to what we noted on the opentable reservation about a birthday, without any additional prompting. real customer service at a high level. highly recommend."
2019-07-12,DeRH,4.0,"the food was as good as always and the new  offerings on the wine list were lovely, unfortunately, the service was a bit off."

2019-07-08,IbrahimS,4.0,although i would warn of the lack of gratuity calculations on the receipt. i inadvertently tipped double and lost $50
2019-07-06,PAMomof3,4.0,restaurant was busy. service was a little slow. food wasn’t as good as previous visit.
2019-07-05,Mima,2.0,"i ordered grey sole and expected a delicate fillet but got tiny scraps of fried fish that were chewy and required a sharp knife to cut. i didn’t complain because i didn’t want to make the evening unpleasant for our guests but for legal seafoods to serve this is shameful! 

additionally, with lobster prices at $5.99 in the grocery store, charging $29 to toss a 1 lb lobster into a pot of water is disgraceful. 

i have dined at legal for years but will hesitate to return."

2019-06-30,Anne,5.0,"friendly, gracious, delicious, excellent service, ambience, excellent food.  they treated us very well from the moment we arrived until the moment we left!"
2019-06-30,skinnybisquit,1.0,food was awful.
2019-06-29,marjo,4.0,"come to legal many times. always happy with food and service. framingham legal is not seaport legal but it is close to home and we go many times. food selection and cocktails and wine selections are always good, and of course food is good. went this time with family, six of us. again, mostly good as usual, but there are a few points to consider.
first - does the kitchen know how to cook vegetables? all of them, broccoli, spinach, etc all come out hard and not cooked. why? this is a standard joke here by many others and not just my table. even the waiters warn you to ask for them to be cooked more!
also, legal still doesn't offer octopus (except at legal 2 at seaport), why the leading seafood chain in ne doesn't who knows why? so, i usually order the raw clams instead - but the price for them has gone from about $18 a dozen to currently, $2.25 each (which is $27 a dozen) in the past 18 months are so. give me a break! 
no octopus, no baked or casino clams and way out of line prices for raw clams. perhaps, that is why other seafood restaurants seem to be doing so well."
2019-06-29,NatickDiner,5.0,great dinner. our waitress - _-autumn g was outstanding. literal every time i go in the prices on most menu items has gone up a buck. at some point they will price me out of the market
2019-06-29,disappointedcustomer,2.0,"a very mediocre restaurant. taste was not anything extraordinary. we had fish and chips, lobster roll(a very small 4 inch long with a $35 price tag) and fish tacos. the taste was no better than any other mom and pop stores that sell fish and chips. very expensive. waiter was ok...but he took a plate away thinking we were done......he just took it off the table telling us we wont eat this.what? i told him my son son is still pecking on it and asked him to leave it and he returned the plate after apologizing. but for a such a supposedly fine restaurant, they should have taught their waiters better manners."
2019-06-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"so good.   shrimp cocktail, cherrystones, blackend chicken, scallops, steamed lobster, good sides, margaritas, sonoma cutrer chard.  great service.  love it!"
2019-06-28,Michael,5.0,great food and service. tyler was attentive but not smothering. i appreciated how they split the plates on both the burrata and tuna (which my wife and i shared). drinks were great to. always consistently good.
2019-06-28,ernestb,4.0,"could have been five stars except it was quite noisy and although the food was very good, i would not rate it a great value."
2019-06-28,Suzjohn44,4.0,good service- a little slow at times but it was busy.
2019-06-28,Dorene,5.0,food was delicious. a little pricey but worth it. server was also very attentive.
2019-06-26,DebbyR,1.0,halibut has no taste scallops we under cooked. sides were horrible never will i go back. it was hirrufuc
2019-06-23,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the menu could do with a revamp and the restaurant could do with a facelift. there were small fruit flies flying around.
2019-06-22,EdmondJ,5.0,this location is one of the best legal locations. the food is always top of the line
2019-06-19,HappytodineatLSF,4.0,"we always enjoy legal sea foods in framingham. service is attentive- and caters to people with allergies and food sensitivities! so appreciated. seafood is always excellent! we always enjoy meeting our niece from ca-who travels to boston on business! 
  (just a ""side"" note- sides are no longer listed on the menu and should have mentioned awhile ago that we miss the awesome baked potatoes you always served!) and we miss the fish tank! other than that- excellent!"
2019-06-19,CathyB,5.0,took visitors from australia here and they were bowled over by the freshness of the sea scallops. our server let us substitute different sides which was so gracious. my friends first taste of chowder was a revelation!
2019-06-18,DavidK,5.0,6/18/19 everything was great
2019-06-18,Ballou,5.0,arthur was a fantastic server. he made sure our food was delivered timely and hot. he waited until the rolls were fresh out of the oven. i had the grilled shrimps and my wife enjoyed her luncheon salmon. we topped off our early dinner/late lunch with a delicious boston verne desert. legal in framingham is still our favorite route 9 location.
2019-06-17,FavoritePlace,4.0,we had a wonderful family lunch. waiter was attentive.  food quite good. nice variety
2019-06-16,ThomasA,5.0,great environment. great food. great service. a perfect place to eat on special days or any day.
2019-06-16,OpenTable Diner,2.0,thought it was standard to give butter with steamers and tarter with clams
2019-06-16,EdwardJ,3.0,"father’s day
food was pretty good. too many broken shells in my steamers, which were unopened so you shouldn’t eat them."
2019-06-16,gigi,5.0,it was terrific and two of our guests really appreciated the gluten free accommodation!
2019-06-16,AnexisS,3.0,the food was subpar at best. the menu was very limited and the flavor was lacking.
2019-06-16,JackF,4.0,generally a good place to eat! no rush and waitstaff are very accommodating.
2019-06-16,BFramingham,3.0,"for the price, it wasn't worth the value. i was disappointed in the slow service and the fact that it took a long time to get through everything. having time to enjoy father's day is one thing. but sitting waiting for luke-warm chowder was disappointing, and having two meals come out before the other two meals came out, meant (out of respect) that our meals weren't piping hot either.  i believe for the price, which is what i expected to pay, but i expected a better overall experience."
2019-06-16,Julie,5.0,"great,  reliable food and service. our waiter ben was very helpful."
2019-06-15,HC70,4.0,"as regulars at legal seafood, my wife and i never cease to be impressed at the quality of the food and the terrific service.  we particularly like the casualness of the bar in framingham, with absolutely no drop-off in quality or service!!!"
2019-06-15,Beth,5.0,"the framingham legal sea foods location is one of the best! they went above and beyond to make my father’s birthday dinner a meal to remember, and the service and food were impeccable."
2019-06-15,christopherm,3.0,"have always liked this chain, but have begun to notice that their food quality is slipping. i can only believe it’s because we’ve deselected the oceans of really awesome cod and haddock. tried to order the maine crab roll but at 2 different legals and at 2 different times if the year have been told that it’s not available. ordered the cod and it was just average. my wife ordered the fried clams and she reported that they’re getting more and more tasteless. i agree as a native new englander quality is becoming abysmal."
2019-06-14,CraigL,2.0,high noise level; limited menu; indifferent service.  legals once was a reliable venue for good seafood.  mu opinion is that they are resting on their laurels.  the dishes are pricey and the menu is limited.  there are other seafood restaurants that offer better value.
2019-06-14,DanaB,3.0,we have been eating at legal for years. it's a solid choice for good food. however the prices are very high and not always worth it.
2019-06-13,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is always great.  we enjoyed clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, the scallop appetizer special, blackened halibut.  always great service from judy.   love it here!"
2019-06-13,Terrence,5.0,our server sergey was excellent!! oysters fresh & delicious! it was busy but because we booked a reservation through open table we were seated at the exact time our reservation was booked for. we were very happy with everything
2019-06-13,DavidM,5.0,"great food, great staff, and great service.  loved the place."
2019-06-13,PetraL,5.0,the food and drinks were as great as always.
2019-06-13,HenryH,5.0,legal consistently delivers excellence.  prices are not out of line.  a great venue for a business lunch.
2019-06-11,SandyB,5.0,waitress was attentive.  food was good.  all diners enjoyed their meals
2019-06-10,michaelB,3.0,"fan above us in bar had to ask twice to get it turned off, then it was turned on again and i had to ask again food was good, service not very attentive"
2019-06-08,DebbieW,3.0,"we frequent legal sea foods a lot. typically we go to the one in chestnut hill. we had a reservation in framingham and ended up getting there early. the hostess offered a table in the lounge to get seated quicker. we were more than happy to sit in lounge area. however neither my husband nor i drink and once the waiter found this out it clearly affected the service he provided.  our food was delayed, which is very unusual and it wasn’t the kitchen’s fault because the table next to us for their food promptly. the waiter never asked us how our food was but he asked the tables (they were drinking) around us. the two tables next to us were seated after us and they received their dinners before us. it was clear he had no interest in us. we had to ask twice for rolls and he brought the other table their rolls right away. we did not see a manager around when we left but i did see business cards the general manager and assistant manager as we were leaving. i emailed both of these individuals when i got home and have yet to receive a response."
2019-06-08,gdavidsesq,4.0,delicious food...spectacular waitress. overall a wonderful experience
2019-06-07,James,5.0,"we love sitting at the bar.  the service is always good, the food is very good and the atmosphere is just the way we like it.  we always come back to legals as one of our favorites"
2019-06-07,Soni,3.0,"first off, the best thing about it was the service. our waiter ( a guy w/a super-long ponytail) was excellent. after that, it was disappointing. no lobster, no more baked potatoes, and the tomato balsamic vinegar had no balsamic vinegar in it and no olive oil - some type of vegetable oil. yucky. i’ve eaten at various legal seafood restaurants over the years & this was the first time it wasn’t up to snuff. will think twice before going again."
2019-06-06,out2dine,4.0,"we came here to celebrate our anniversary. we got a large booth, but were next to a large party. lobster and the lobster bake were excellent. the 1.25 lobster had a lot of meat and some parts were cut to make it easier. the lobster bake had a generous portion of mussels and steamers to share. legals clam chowder is always the best, delicious! the waiter was busy, so service was average. we always enjoy dinner at legal’s and plan to return."
2019-06-04,FavoritePlace,5.0,"wanted to be assured of great food while entertaining out of town guests. food was great .
service was outstanding."
2019-06-03,BeverlyE,5.0,"for all these years, they've served dependably and truly delicious fish and seafood.  and when we recently celebrated my daughter-in-law's birthday at legal's, the cheesecake dessert with fresh raspberries and a lit candle was just the berries!"
2019-06-02,operafan,2.0,"for a fairly expensive restaurant, legal in framingham did not measure up.  there were 8 of us, and for many of us the meals were very poor.  the kale salad was literally that, because it was difficult to find any ingredients other than kale, and came drenched with dressing, which was ordered on the side.  the soup was much too salty.  the salmon and accompanying vegetables were dramatically undercooked could not put a fork or even a knife through them) , and almost inedible.  the tuna was served blackened  (which was not ordered) but it would have been too destructive of timing to send it back.  the swordfish was ok, but the serving definitely small.  the other meals were ok.  the wait staff was attentive, although not careful about who ordered what.  the noise level on a busy evening was very high.  in general, it was not at all a success.  we doubt we shall return."
2019-06-02,AmyI,5.0,"excellent dining experience - food was delicious and service was noticeably great, thanks!"
2019-06-01,ArleneG,5.0,"excellent as always

2019-05-31,OpenTable Diner,5.0,birthday. it was very good as always.
2019-05-31,Marcus,5.0,good experience. will recommend
2019-05-29,Ballou,5.0,"judy is the best! one of best values at legal is its haddock fish sandwich! for under $15, you get a great sandwich, two great sides, and rolls and butter! 
legal quality and ambiance for an excellent price!"
2019-05-26,TimD,5.0,has a 3 pound lobster ---- perfect dinner fantastic service and food
2019-05-25,TryNewPlaces,2.0,"we met friends for dinner. the food was good including the desert. service was good - our server was very busy but kept an eye on us and was there when we needed him and he was very pleasant. we had only one major complaint. we were seated in the board room, which is a small private area.  we first thought was a good thing because it was not noisy and we could easily converse. then a large party of 9 consisting of children, parents and infant were seated. the infant kept crying. then another party of four were seated  across from us and they began playing music loudly on their smart phone. the music was very annoying and disruptive - even more so than the crying baby, which on its own was very annoying. we were just about to ask to be moved outside to another table, when the large group left and then the table of 4 turned off their phone. our server was very apologetic and compted the desert for us. unfortunately the damage had been done and our dining experience was poor. while we will continue to visit legal's in natick, we will never allow ourselves to be seated in the boardroom again."
2019-05-23,ArleneG,5.0,"was great 
wonderful waitress"
2019-05-22,TheDog,4.0,food was great
2019-05-21,Ballou,5.0,"cassandra was outstanding!  we enjoyed our usual luncheon salmon, but with a special side of carrots. cassandra served extra lemon butter sauce and herb vinegaette  on the side-nice touch."
2019-05-20,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal, as usual.  tonight... margarita, house salad, baked stuffed shrimp, sonoma cutrer chard, bon bon.  so good!!!"
2019-05-19,Bruce,5.0,"as usual, the food and service were excellent. the temperature in the restaurant was a bit too cool but the staff was very responsive in moderating the temperature."
2019-05-19,Geepsie,3.0,"we have been legal sea foods patrons for years. we are seeing it become more assembly line, rather than individualized or ""quality in every entree"".  the standout part of the meal was the inventive wine list.  other than that, my fried clams were dry and not crisp enough, the french fries were not crisp enough."
2019-05-19,Foodisgood,5.0,"legals is consistently a great experience.  our table was near the kitchen so we heard some noises at times, but it did not take away from the overall dining experience."
2019-05-19,DebraC,5.0,the server was possibly a new guy. he repeated everything to make sure he got it right.
2019-05-19,JudyG,5.0,"this legal seem to have a smaller menu, but the food was excellent. service was great and overall experience was wonderful."
2019-05-18,BoriquanMami,4.0,very glad for all of the gluten free options available!
2019-05-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we went for an early dinner.   the food was great and our server,serge, is fantastic!!!!"
2019-05-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,accommodated large party with many young children. food and drinks were great. perfect for our graduation dinner.
2019-05-16,kurt,2.0,"i ordered fish and chips. i received broken up, small pieces and tailings of fish. i expect to receive a nice think fillet. so why didn’t i send it back if not satisfied?  how about: why does legal charge a premium and deliver a substandard meal?  is your quality control and standards really that bad?  you covered up the lousy pieces of fish with lots of onion strings. nice try. 
i’ve been going to legal for over 40 years. what the heck is going on with quality?????"
2019-05-16,Approve,4.0,disappointed with the high lives of salt in the special entree this time around but overall normally a great seafood place. management did give us a dessert comp but restaurants as a whole need to stop putting so much salt in their food.
2019-05-16,JanetO,4.0,"as usual the service was impeccable. the food was as well, except they changed the way they make the sashimi tuna app and i will never order it again. i have had that for years and loved it. now they have a lot of soy sauce type sauce all over the tuna (it used to be dry and you could add sauce yourself). it also seems to be a slightly lower cut of tuna and several of my pieces had some sort of grizzle or fibers inside of it. if it were just the sauce i may consider getting it without sauce but the quality of tuna seems downgraded as well so won’t order anymore. others may like if you like a salty soy sauce on you sashimi"
2019-05-13,Joanie,3.0,"our appetizers were pretty good but our entrees were cafeteria quality, and one was not what we ordered. we ordered a special wild salmon with mashed potatoes and provençal herb butter. what arrived was basically steam-table at a buffet quality salmon with no sauce, 3 baby red potatoes that were boiled whole with the skins on and served plain, and steamed broccoli that looked overdone and unappetizing. we were billed for the $36 special we ordered. the server acknowledged the food was wrong, said they were out of the special, and that was it. i would have taken the time to complain but our kid was at his breaking point and we just needed to get out. i’m in the industry. i think the food was was server error in giving us the wrong salmon dish,  but regardless, that was lower quality food preparation than i would have gotten from the hot foods bar at whole foods, and i could have gotten that for $15. my entree was decent but kinda underwhelming. again, i’m in the industry and know a good amount about food and the restaurants out there, and for this $$, we could have gone to a much finer restaurant."
2019-05-12,Kandace,3.0,"family of 4, we went to celebrate mother’s day and my sons birthday. neither were really acknowledged by the waiter or the hostess when we were seated, even though i made it clear when making the reservation. i guess this place doesn’t care. we ordered an appetizer of calamari, rhode island style, we were brought the regular. they did end up bringing us the correct order. i ordered the arctic char, kale salad and polenta. i got salmon, spinach and polenta. i didn’t want to send it back since they already messed up the calamari. it was disappointing but it tasted fine. it’s sad to pay that much to dine out and have so many problems."
2019-05-12,SamuelB,5.0,"absolutely recommend
as always absolutely fresh fish, some unique items on their menu
abundant portions; healthy cooking
best for family celebration.
needed to change from 4 to 5 persons at last minute and even though it was mothers day they found a larger table rather than crowding round a smaller
great place."
2019-05-12,JayA,5.0,nice time but the booth in the bar area staring directly into the service bar area is a tough view for the entire meal.
2019-05-12,Cindy,5.0,our waiter serg was the best extremely accommodating.
2019-05-12,RBFramingham,5.0,great food and service. all courses were refreshing presented by friendly and helpful staff.

2019-05-11,Klink,4.0,"our dishes were satisfying, especially the ""nutty salmon"" with its yummy mushroom ravioli. one of us had the lobster, and he was also pleased. we were seated in a booth as we requested, and we were able to hear one another talk, a victory for a busy saturday night."
2019-05-11,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great food and our server was was even better
2019-05-11,HeatherL,3.0,"the noise was over the top in the bar area due to dishes, trays, and glasses constantly banging. ask for a corner table in the dining room if you want fine dining.  also, i've been coming here for years and the overall decor needs a refresh.  baked stuffed lobster $77, a bit much.  on a positive note, our server was very good."
2019-05-11,RaquelP,5.0,great food and awesome service! would recommend going here
2019-05-10,Ceat1,4.0,"celebrate a 70th birthday.
the waiter was good and was sensitive to us having a leisurely lunch.
he was most accommodating.

we had some special requests for the meals and he was excellent in seeing what we wanted.

the complimentary dessert for the birthday girl of ice cream filled non bond was a nice touch!!
all around great experience!"
2019-05-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great food and service
2019-05-08,Francesca,2.0,"i was very disappointed with my experience .  first of all it was so loud that we had to strain to hear each other.  then i had the sandwich special, a soft shelled crab, thinking that since it was the beginning of the soft shell crab season, it would be nice and fresh.  however, it was not...it was fishy tasting...definitely not fresh!  not good for a fish restaurant!  i could not finish it. 
i have to say that when the server saw that i hadn't finished and asked if i wanted to take it home, she offered to talk to the chef and perhaps comp it for me.  however one of my friends said that her dogs would love it, so we got a real doggie bag and she took it home.
the servers were very good."
2019-05-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent experience. our waitress, pam, was terrific. friendly, informed, helpful.  service was prompt. food was very good. portions good.  a pleasant evening."

2019-05-05,EricD,5.0,consistently the best seafood in the area. the waitstaff is always knowledgeable and attentive. legal never disappoints!
2019-05-05,Crossen,3.0,"the legal seafood chain restaurants — sorry, that’s what they’ve become — are all the same: big, noisy, overpriced, high-volume food-delivery factories. if there’s good news in all that, it is that you know just what to expect when you go to one.
the framingham experience was just a little worse than average: very brusque, even surly, treatment at reception, and the place seemed significantly noisier than the usual noisy instance of a legal."
2019-05-05,lilli,5.0,always my favorite place to eat. i love their caesar salad with maine crab meat. get it nearly every time and never disappoints.
2019-05-05,Lynne,5.0,my mom and i had a delicious meal at legals as always.  we had the clam chowder and the grilled shrimp.   the service was great too!
2019-05-04,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"i made a reservation for a birthday for 7:45pm. i got there at 7:40pm and was told i had to wait because i was early... really by 5 min ... ok.  then they tried to give me a table in the bar area. i told them i would wait for a table in the dining room. it was a bigger table , the server seemed a little annoyed that there wasn’t more of us at the table so service was slow in the beginning. in then end the server was nice...food was good. but overall not a good birthday experience. the chestnut hill  location has better service. even though i live closer to this location ... i won’t be back."
2019-05-04,CynthiaQ,3.0,"although the food was delicious, i thought it was overpriced. the portions were small for the price. the waiter we had was inattentive. we actually had to ask him to smile. i could have had fish for half the price elsewhere and enjoyed it just as much. i won’t be back."
2019-05-04,SusanC,5.0,great meal and a fantastic waitress...
2019-05-03,Jade,5.0,legal seafood is a staple restaurant for my family and i. so far every time i have dined at any legal seafood establishment it has always been a wonderful experience.

2019-05-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food was really good and the waitress was amazing.
2019-04-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is an institution... so good.  today's house salad with peppercorn dressing, blackened halibut (perfectly cooked) with mashed potatoes... all excellent.  rarely have dessert but we did today. 
cheesecake, and key lime pie in a graham cracker crust... both very good.  sonoma cutrer chardonnay excellent match with dinner.  service from judy, always fantastic!"
2019-04-28,LauraM,5.0,"legal seafood continues to provide delicious food and fabulous service. i have two children with multiple severe food allergies, and legal seafood always provides the highest level of care. i completely trust their handling and process. that kind of trust is hard to earn from an allergy mom. thank you legal seafood."
2019-04-27,BrittP,2.0,"we are regular customers and we always have had good experiences. this time, we had the worst service and the experience was miserable."
2019-04-27,HildaD,5.0,"legal never disappoints. fresh, well prepared seafood. excellent service."
2019-04-27,jsands222,4.0,everything was really good for food and service. what was very annoying was the face that every 5-7 minutes a young lady walked by with a tablet indicating where each table was with their food. i felt we were being rushed so they could clear the table and seat another party. once or twice would be fine. towards the end she came by every 2 minutes. highly disruptive to a nice meal and experience.
2019-04-27,KayD,1.0,my meal was so bad i  ate one bite  and that was it. you used to be able to count on legal always being good....not anymore. don't bother and don't waste money there.
2019-04-27,MariaG,5.0,"excellent, service excellent, food great staff perfect, cordial polite"
2019-04-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,legal is always consistent with some wonderful signature meals.  albeit pricey the food is good enough to sustain turn values
2019-04-26,Waylandguy,4.0,"food was high quality, as always. service was attentive but gave us space and time to have a leisurely meal. the only negative is the price; one really has to pay for what one wants and gets. but that has always been the case and why we all always go back!"

2019-04-21,Lainey,3.0,"we ordered the buttered lobster rolls, which were not very tasty.  the lobster was rubbery and didn't taste fresh.  the grey sole (which we loved in the past) had a lot of skin on it and was dry.  the room was nice (only about 4-5 tables in it, so felt semi-private; however, the music went from nice, dinner music to sometimes 90's rock (not really appropriate for easter dinner.  the service was very good, especially considering this was easter sunday, and they were very busy."

2019-04-17,FriendsAnniversary35,5.0,"legal seafoods is one of my favorite dining experiences, no matter where. the seafood is exceptional, with so many choices and flavors for fresh taste options. the service is phenomenal and the staff is so well-trained, not only with the menu, and the wine pairings, but also on all the little touches that make the customer's visit and experience so memorable with friends and family. highly recommend!"
2019-04-17,MichaelA,5.0,"as always the food was fabulous!!! server were great! my daughter has a milk allergy and everyone was so accommodating to her needs. only complaint, and it is a small one, was the amount of noise. it was difficult to hear others across our table. over all, it was a fantastic experience!"
2019-04-16,AAWood,4.0,"quality of food and service was excellent
 however, despite a reservation, our table was in a draughty corner right by the service exit. our waiter kindly swapped our table but we still missed out on the ambiance the larger areas of the restaurant had to offer."
2019-04-15,meredithr,5.0,we had a long day and everyone was helpful and the food was delicious. thank you!
2019-04-14,Nadine,5.0,"very nice location, spacious, nicely decorated, excellent, friendly staff, fresh and tasty food, always a hit when visiting the area."
2019-04-14,NancyD,3.0,"we usually love our family lunches at legal in framingham. not today. the kid's meal was disappointing: 4 ravioli served with overcooked broccoli and mushy watermelon; the mediterranean salmon which is served with hummus and a cucumber/yogurt sauce had been sitting under the heating elements so long that the yogurt sauce was warm and the hummus had a crust on it; the server was anything but attentive: he greeted us about 10 minutes after we had been seated and didn't take our drink order; once our order had been placed, only 1 person in our party ordered a drink (iced tea) and our server had to be reminded to bring it. it was not a very busy afternoon, yet the entrees took ""forever"" to arrive, and we sat with empty plates for far too long before anyone acknowledged that we might be done with our lunch. we'll probably give legal a break for a bit..."
2019-04-13,ShawnA,4.0,food and service were excellent.  i would have preferred to see more fresh fish choices.
2019-04-13,Dianna,3.0,i took my kids and the experience was just ok. we go to legal c all the time and it never disappoints. but this time i was not terribly satisfied. the service was not good. food was ok  but not good enough to go back anytime soon.
2019-04-13,Never8to5,4.0,we always enjoy legal seafood and have come to expect great food!  we have never been disappointed. it’s a little expensive but it’s a sure bet.
2019-04-12,Ballou,5.0,"one of the best seafood restaurants in the area! our superb server, judy, made our visit extra special. my wife and i ordered the luncheon salmon. she had broccoli and polenta and i enjoyed polenta and butter nut squash. everything was served piping hot and delicious! we both love lemon butter sauce (judy brought extra) with our salmon. extra cheese sauce made my wife’s broccoli super tasty. for desert we enjoyed strawberry shortcake served with whipped cream. the dinner rolls were right of the oven. thanks to our open table request, we had our favorite table. thanks to judy, our experience was outstanding. looking for a late lunch or early dinner in framingham or natick? look to legal seafood on route 9 across from the natick mall. easy access to route 9 and to the mass pike."
2019-04-11,MaryanneW,5.0,the salmon was cooked perfectly...as always!  great service too
2019-04-11,ChristianC,5.0,"the staff was very pleasant, helpful and attentive. 
we were meeting for some business discussions and the dinner went on for a few hours of talk, eat, more talk. 

we were not disturbed or passed dirty looks because we lingered a bit longer than anticipated and they were very kind and pleasant when we left."
2019-04-10,srdtf,5.0,"i found their vegetarian options limited but frankly, quite good. the ""bang bang cauliflower"" is an excellent dish. the salad was a largish portion, but well made. to be fair, this is not a vegetarian restaurant, but it is 2019 in a boston burb and you should expect vegetarians to visit, even if they understand your primary clientele is there for the fish."
2019-04-09,ValerieU,5.0,love the food and the service!  and they are willing to adjust their menu for special requests.
2019-04-07,Rosy,5.0,the hostess had the music turned down when i requested it . the waiter was excellent and the food was superb.
2019-04-06,DavidC,4.0,"as usual, legal provides a consistent, high quality experience. service was top notch at one of the bar area high-tops on saturday evening. it is an ""active"" atmosphere meaning loud with talking but not too loud. char was perfect and the fried clams as well; crispy outside and moist inside. they also still have sam adams cold snap on tap which is great since many places have already moved to summer ale !"
2019-04-05,SergioFroes,5.0,place is amazing! never disappoints! my family and i can’t wait to go back!
2019-04-05,GeorgeG,5.0,"always fantastic and look forward to returning.  great food, wonderful service and outstanding atmosphere."
2019-04-05,StatLady,5.0,delicious food as usual and outstanding wait staff.
2019-04-04,StetC,4.0,the oysters were great and the wine delicious.  we both enjoyed the swordfish.
2019-04-03,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is always excellent.  tonight tried something different... blackened chicken, with mashed potatoes... very good for a change.  shrimp cocktail (the best around) and a bon bon for dessert.  so good!"
2019-04-02,Bruce,5.0,legal’s in framingham provides the reliably high quality of legal seafood. it also has welcoming staff and comfortable seating. it’s always a pleasure to eat there.
2019-04-02,KathleenB,5.0,"our server was amazing. 
my siblings and i go out for lunch every month or so, and we linger over lunch and dessert. the waitstaff at legal never rushes and is always accommodating of our various needs and menu questions/substitutions. great spot for us to hang out together."
2019-03-31,AndrewF,3.0,"last two times i've dined here the food was not worth the price. in fact, the fried whole clams were more rubbery and overcooked then the clam strips i used to get at hojo's 50 years ago.
other sites are good. must be a manager issue.
hope the place gets better and pays attention to these reviews"
2019-03-29,ConnieD,1.0,service was slow and not attentive.
2019-03-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is always a satisfying dining experience.  loved our chowder, house salad, shrimp cocktail, cherrystones, halibut w/mashed.  excellent service from kylie s."
2019-03-27,CassieB,3.0,at the one we went the bar area was the place to be!
2019-03-24,bobbieJ,4.0,"the table was ready, the food was good even tho they didn’t bring what i ordered. the server was friendly but forgetful."
2019-03-24,AaronO,5.0,my only complaint is that it is a bit on the pricey side but i guess you can expect that. great food! great service and great environment! i'd definitely recommend to a friend if they're willing to spend a bit extra on a good meal.
2019-03-23,HC70,5.0,"legal seafood never fails to deliver  -  always the freshest of seafood, expertly prepared!!"
2019-03-23,BarbaraC,4.0,"i had asked for a booth away from the bar but not too far away as one person in the party is handicapped and finds walking too far difficult. this request was not honored.

however, the waiter was excellent and made our experience more worthwhile."
2019-03-23,YanyR,5.0,special dinner with friends
2019-03-22,stasju,5.0,awesome as always. tastes great good service easy access
2019-03-22,StatLady,5.0,delicious crab cakes and excellent service
2019-03-21,Regulars,3.0,"disappointed in the food.  the brown rice with leeks was so greasy and oily and that really ruined the taste of the salmon meal for me.  that grease just seeped into all the fish and side items on the plate. 
i didn't complain but feel it needs to be known that the rice should be removed from this menu."
2019-03-20,BethH,4.0,if you are looking for delicious fresh seafood this is the place to come.  not gourmet but simple and delicious.  wine selection by the glass is also very good.
2019-03-19,middleeasterngourmand18,5.0,our waiter was outstanding
2019-03-19,2Fans,1.0,"we have been fans of ls since the 60s, and this was been one of our favorite locations.  it needs a face lift and better quality control.  all 3 of the fish chosen for the sampler were overcooked.  i had a much superior experience at the philadelphia airport."
2019-03-18,PaulL,5.0,food was great. kudos to the service.  i will definitely recommend.
2019-03-17,Lucky,5.0,"service was excellent and the food was excellent.  a little pricey, but expected."
2019-03-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent food, you won't be disappointed.  easy to get to, plenty of parking."
2019-03-16,Newtonfoodie,4.0,need more attentive servers at the bar when the restaurant is busy.
2019-03-16,EdCroak,4.0,very good service from a very experienced waiter.  very good food with large portions.
2019-03-16,MaryR,4.0,"always good food at legal seafoods, but the restaurant is looking tired and old. service was excellent and all staff were nice and helpful."
2019-03-16,DeborahH,3.0,salmon was dry and overdone.  calamari portion was less than what we've had many times before.
2019-03-16,PeteF,3.0,"we were seated next to a part of 7 who were obnoxiously loud. 
the most disappointing was the food. a $30 lobster roll should have alot of lobster.  it nearly filled a hot dog bun.
i had their sea bass special with risotto.  the fish was cooked fine. but the risotto was complete mush. it was like eating bland cream of wheat. 5 of the 6 oysters i had were good, the 6th was borderline spoiled.
i will not go back"
2019-03-16,RobO,5.0,"we went on a very crowded saturday afternoon yet felt we were evening dining throughout the meal. a bit noisy, but everyone was enjoying the food and each other, can't beat that with a stick. food was very good as always and the staff never disappoints."
2019-03-15,Outandabout14,3.0,"waiter said he started 3 months ago. he was  pleasant but slow and disorganized. 
he kept forgetting to pick up our wine order from the bar.  it was particularly annoying as we are both in our 60’s. one patron in a wheelchair and he insisted on seeing our id. 
my companion in the wheelchair is 64 and  doesn’t even drive so finding id for a glass of wine seemed ridiculous and unnecessary. 
we asked for rolls which also took forever as he was confused about which table resisted them.   not a great experience even though we made a reservation."
2019-03-14,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is always a treat... so reliable.  dinner tonight no exception... shrimp cocktail (fantastic), blackened halibut, grilled scallop skewer (a special), mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  excellent margaritas and wines by the glass.  excellent service."
2019-03-14,Raven,5.0,we dine at legal seafood in natick several times a year and find that the food and service is always very good.
2019-03-14,MarthaC,5.0,"i had a delicious grilled shrimp dinner, and the waiter was extremely attentive. the lump crab dip appetizeris beyond delicious and i highly recommend it!"
2019-03-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great as always!!!
2019-03-10,KevinG,1.0,"we waited for almost 20 minutes just to get our order taken, then nearly an hour to get our dinner.....then my daughters food was not correct, but i was not about to wait again for food....
i have enjoyed legal sea food in the past, but it will be a while before we go back again, if we ever go back....."
2019-03-10,OpenTable Diner,5.0,waitress amazing!
2019-03-10,TryNewPlaces,3.0,"we eat at legals in natick occasionally and usually it is a good experience. however this time it was not so great. while we were seated right away, our server seemed to be extremely busy. we waited longer than normal for everything - from drinks to desert. our server was very friendly but seemed to be extremely busy or there was something up in the kitchen. my husband and friends are fish eaters. i am not. their entrees while hot were just okay. my husband said his salmon was just so so. i ordered the pan seared chicken, which i have had in the past and enjoyed. this time i think they nuked it. the skin was so hard i had trouble cutting into it and the meat very dry.  the vegetables however were just fine. as was the wine we drank. the desert, maple bread pudding, was just so so, not really worth the calories  we have had better dinners here in the past.  i guess legals is hit or miss these days. sad."
2019-03-09,RickV,2.0,i really have to question what is going on with legal seafood. i booked the reservation via opentable for a date night with my wife. what a mistake. they sat us at the very worst table in the entire restaurant right next to the kitchen door at a table where the table extensions which folded underneath didn't stay up and where constantly falling onto my legs.  i could not hear my wife for much of the dinner. deeply disappointed.
2019-03-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,birthday for friend. server was excellent and made his birthday a surprise. i give the young lady serving our group 5 stars!
2019-03-09,TableOf6,5.0,"always reliable to have a fun, busy yet unhurried atmosphere and incredible clam chowder and meals"
2019-03-09,John,5.0,always worth while.  good food and service. can't say anything else.
2019-03-08,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal rules!  always a satisfying meal here.  tonight, the classics... clam chowder and a steamed lobster.... with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  fine attentive service, as usual.  so good!"
2019-03-08,Peetie,5.0,"all 4 of us  enjoyed the evening thoroughly. the food was excellent and service good (i love the bang bang cauliflower appetizer, my wife her fried clams, our friends the clam chowder). the ambience was a little less than normal as they swept the floor right up to our table at 9:30 p.m. - otherwise as on our previous visits an excellent place and the daily special ginger glazed mahi - mahi excellent!"
2019-03-07,BryanL,5.0,typical legal
2019-03-06,MeredithK,5.0,"excellent service, great chowder and great recommendation of salmon entree!"
2019-03-05,Bottomline222,4.0,we have been frequent guests at this location since they opened and felt it was a great place to go for lunch to celebrate my wife’s birthday. always excellent service and a friendly smile from the staff.
2019-03-03,lilli,5.0,"for a really good meal, we always turn to legal. my favorite is the caesar salad with crab meet. so satisfying!"
2019-03-03,David,4.0,we go here a lot. food is fresh + delicious.  the clam chowder is the best anywhere _ and i am an afiicionado of clam chowders.  they were obviously under staffed + overwhelmed + the service was gracious but slow. fried foods can be great or awful from visit to visit. stick w fresh fish.
2019-03-03,Donuts,3.0,sad to say it’s not what it used to be.  fried shrimp was burnt and they new it because the burnt side was on the bottom when presented.  my husband’s order was not correct as was the table next to us.   waitress was very nice but for the money- not the best.  first time ever in decades giving a so so review
2019-03-02,BigD,5.0,the hostess and server could not have been more accommodating. the meal was delicious which is typical of most of our visits to legal. we will definitely continue to find our way there.
2019-03-02,Ronn,5.0,i always enjoy legal. first time in framingham! food was excellent
2019-03-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we have noticed there are more and more fruit flies in this legal seafood from our visit for the past 2 times. food is good and service is fine. we compared it with legal sea bar (seaport) and legal sea bar is cleaner, without fruit flies. it’s quite annoying to have it flying all over my lobsters and oysters."
2019-03-01,YSKim,5.0,"tyler our server was courteous, attentive and effective.  our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to our table timely.  as always, i had a wonderful dining experience at the legal sea foods in framingham, ma.  thanks, tyler!  y.s. kim"
2019-02-27,Raif,4.0,legal always provide lots of well prepared options.
2019-02-27,TripAdvisor,5.0,"doesn't get much better than legal.  always excellent.  tonight had the blackened halibut with mashed potatoes... started with a house salad with creamy peppercorn.  a glass of sonoma cutrer chardonnay.  amazing, attentive service from judy."
2019-02-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,food was mediocre. disappointing experience.
2019-02-26,Satdinner,5.0,it was excellent. food was good. a little pricey.
2019-02-25,YSKim,5.0,"we were lucky to have eddie f. for our table.  he was courteous, attentive, professional, efficient and effective.  all our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to our table timely.  thank you very much for the dessert on him."
2019-02-24,BeverlyS,4.0,"i really hope that legal sea foods management gets this review. i took a party of 9 to the framingham location for a birthday celebration. the service , food quality and value were great. however, 3 members of the party were children. one of the children has a nut allergy and we told our server. she was fantastic about advising us on foods. although there were no nuts in anything we ordered, many other foods were prepared in kitchens that don't segregate foods for nut allergants. we could not have  their own homemade rolls nor any dessert, including ice cream or birthday cake.  it would seem to me that a restaurant chain like legals, which is upscale and fairly pricey, would be conscious of the need to provide alternatives for children and adults who can't eat nuts (or gluten, or dairy). we could not order for anyone at our table because we could not tell one child to abstain from eating dessert while the rest of us ate.  our birthday party ended up with three upset children and six unhappy adults."
2019-02-24,SeanM,5.0,"my husband had taken me for my 26th birthday. everything was perfect. we had been before more than a handful of times. never had an experience like this, our waiter was by far the best we have had. wish i remembered his name! thank you for such a pleasant dinner!"
2019-02-24,VartusV,5.0,food is always good but the prices not so much. a bit expensive.
2019-02-24,cupahjoe,3.0,"my wife and i go to legal's at least once a year. unfortunately, the good food options are dwindling. service is slightly above average. i stood at the front desk with 3 hostesses looking at me until i introduced myself. our waiter did a fine job. started with a dozen oysters, which are always a solid choice. the bottle of ferret puilly-fuisse was excellent. my wife's grilled arctic char with scallops was very good. my ""haddock imperial"" was very over cooked and, surprisingly, lacked flavor. the presentation of both dishes was awful. it looked like someone just sent the dish down the line and put scoops of rice and squash and greens on a plate, e.g. cafeteria style presentation. for dessert, the maple bread pudding was tasty but nothing special. our decaf coffee was excellent. when a dinner for two costs more than $220, i expect much better cooking and presentation. my suggestion, stick with the grilled dishes and oysters. anything else on the menu is like playing roulette."
2019-02-23,LoBH,2.0,"server was pleasant, friendly, helpful
service was very very slow
1/2 hour before ordering food
and then took almost an hour to get our food
one plate (crabcake) was messy and unappetizing and the portion was very small
one plate was missing ingredients (no sausage in the fisherman stew); manager reduced price by $2
disappointing"
2019-02-22,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"our meals were very good and but service was poor because the waiter did not provide the exceptional service we usually receive.  the waiter lacked enthusiasm, did not offer specials, talk up the menu or have an interest in us as a patron; no social skills and poor waitstaff skills.  also, he did not clear appetizer plates and dirty silverware before the entrees arrived which completely annoys me."
2019-02-22,StephenS,4.0,"food was good...a bit pricey for the amount of food on the plate. the service was slow at first, then once the waiter realized i had been waiting for someone to show up to give me water and take the order he was attentive."
2019-02-22,TracyH,4.0,"while the meal was delicious, the presentation was not attractive.  the plate was over crowded andbwould be more inviting if it was served in a larger plate."
2019-02-21,williamp,4.0,very nice lunch with friends
2019-02-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had a lovely evening. the food was amazing as we always expect. our waitress was fantastic. i believe her name was camila but i don’t have the best hearing. she made it a wonderful evening for us we don’t often splurge at nice places like that but it was great to be taken care of and get our moneys worth.
2019-02-19,LarryO,5.0,"the food was excellent.  i had the halibut steak, which was perfectly cooked and my wife had the anna scrod dinner, which was also excellent.  the halibut was sweet and a nice thick cut.  we shared a maple bread pudding with ice cream for desert and it was excellent as well.  our waiter, gus m, was very attentive, without being obtrusive.   a very nice dinner, with great service."
2019-02-19,Linda,4.0,"eddy was a great server.

2019-02-17,Cece13,5.0,"as always, legal seafood did not disappoint.  i think they changed the tuna burger arrangement so it no longer comes with a red pepper aioli or it's much milder now. i liked it spicy. lol"
2019-02-16,Shaun,4.0,"food was good, service was good. drinks were not good."
2019-02-16,Mitch,5.0,as always legal seafood was a wonderful place to go for a great dinner. i had the grilled tuna steak. medium rare and done to perfection. all the meals were excellent including the lemon caper sole. will return.

2019-02-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,service was impeccable. food was consistent with legal seafood standards. all good.
2019-02-15,LeleC,5.0,"i love the legal sea food in framingham, they have on the menu some dishes that they don’t have in others legals, the food is very good, the service too and the ambiance is very nice. i really recommend this restaurant!"

2019-02-15,Gordon,5.0,"been going to legal seafoods for years, foods fantastic with quick  service. we leave happy and full every time.  always seated at or before reservation time. thank you legal seafoods!!!"
2019-02-14,bararn,5.0,we've been to legal so many times we've lost track. they always honor our reservations and we can count on excellent food without exception.
2019-02-14,KatieD,4.0,the stuffed lobster that was featured that evening was not worth the price. the stuffing consisted mostly of mushy ritz crackers. my husband and i have been going to legal seafoods every valentine’s day for the past 10 years and i always get the baked stuffed lobster. this was the first year i was disappointed.
2019-02-14,BeneNight,5.0,"had the arctic char. it was excellent. you can change the side dishes and they are all very good. shrimp cocktail was huge and delicious. clam chowder delicious and full of clams. and, most importantly, judy our waitress was excellent."
2019-02-13,JoeyD,2.0,"my meal was terrible. shrimp special with only 4 shrimp! enough cauliflower for a lifetime
paper straws leave an aftertaste in your mouth
no ri clam chowder “not at this location”
no decaf coffee! wtf?
“we’re not a chain” yes you are! people come to you for consistency; which you don’t have"
2019-02-13,LucasU,4.0,great food. nice atmosphere. service was good. i would recommend this place to everyone.
2019-02-09,michellec,5.0,"we had a delicious dinner here last night. carlos, our waiter, was excellent. very attentive to every need, made for an exceptional experience. the food, as always, was fresh and prepared perfectly.  the only complaint i would have is the noise level, which made it hard to have a conversation at our table. it is a large restaurant so i understand there's not much you can do about that. what i do love is the decor, it really is beautiful. one of my favorite spots to eat!"
2019-02-09,y0c0chick44,5.0,"service was so great, the food is always top-quality!"
2019-02-09,physs,4.0,the food was great - lots of specials to choose from. our server was very personable and attentive.
2019-02-08,KarlaW,5.0,"the food was delicious, fresh, and fast. a bit pricey but i would treat myself to a meal like that for splurge dates. it is so worth it."
2019-02-08,Fitfoodie54,2.0,"legal seafood has definitely gone down hill. i am a frequent diner and take family and friends there in hopes that it will improve. our server, was rushed, splashed water all over me and the table and never gave it a second look. he forgot we had put in an order for apps and came back to ask us again. when coffee came our server reached across the font of me and put his shirt cuff in my coffee and never gave it a thought. we had to ask the busboy for rolls. he brought 4 for the 8 of us! really?
the food was ok. the value is high. this used to be my favorite place to go for seafood, but no more.
the management needs to look at the fact that male servers are not great with etiquette, details, thinking ahead, and being aware of the needs of the table. female servers are better at all of these. why do you have male servers ? there were 2 female servers in the entire restaurant. this is the one in framingham btw. i/ we recommend going to a steak house to get better seafood and service. go to paparazzi in wellesley as well. skip legals."
2019-02-02,RafaelS,4.0,"overall great food, service, and ambiance. the problem which is why i didn't give a complete 5 star review is a problem with all restaurants, not just legal. what is the point of making an appointment if you're going to have to wait for a table. this has become the norm at most restaurants which defeats the purpose of making a reservation. if i have a 6:45pm reservation and i arrive early, i don't mind waiting but punctually at 6:45pm i should be on my way to the table, not handed a buzzer to wait for my table."
2019-02-02,OpenTable Diner,3.0,maybe a bad choice to go on a saturday night. hostess was overwhelmed and it was chaos in the reception area
2019-02-02,LisaW,4.0,"legal sea foods is a restaurant that you can always depend on to get a good meal.  it's not gourmet food but it's cooked well and it's fresh and delicious.  we had an outstanding waitress who did a tremendous job dealing with a food allergy.  one of the people in our party didn't mention an allergy because she didn't think it would be in the dish.  when the dish came the vegetable was on the plate and they had forgotten to add sesame seeds to the fish as asked.  they immediately took the plate away, re-prepared the food and the manager delivered it very concerned that our friend hadn't ingested anything that she was allergic to.  we sat at the table for way longer than we should have on a very busy saturday night.  no one bothered us or pushed us that they needed the table.  at the end of the night they hadn't charged us for the dish that had to be re-prepared.  i thought all in all it was excellent service and a very good meal.  i would highly recommend."
2019-02-02,CharlesS,5.0,"as usual, our meal at legal seafood in framingham was outstanding.  sergey was a fantastic waiter, and we always have fun when he takes care of us - highly recommended!"
2019-02-01,AndriaD,5.0,"our server was knowledgeable, friendly and the food is always perfect. she even decorated our bill with balloons as it was our first anniversary."
2019-02-01,TripAdvisor,5.0,"never gets old here... always a great meal.  tonight, my house salad and lobster was excellent.  guest enjoyed shrimp cocktail and cherrystones.  excellent service, as usual."
2019-01-26,AlanM,4.0,"the food as usual was very good and our waiter was very good, but as my wife has food allergy, it required(?) a manager to bring her food.  i was served but she wasn't and each time a course was served, we had to ask for her food, which took time to get to the table.  even for ice cream but to their credit, they did not charge for coffee and her dessert, and were apologetic. otherwise, we enjoyed the dinner."
2019-01-26,BradB,4.0,"restaurant was very busy. service was just ok. you would have thought the server would be more attentive and quick to be interactive, personable, and smiling. it took a bit for drinks and a bottle of wine to arrive. wine selection was ok, but very pricey! food was good, but on one plate the spinach was not stir fried to perfection. looked like a rush job in a busy environment. overall, we enjoy the restaurant, but know there can be some finishing touches added to raise the satisfaction to another level. we would like to see weekend varying chef’s special dishes! they add to a menu and bring a smile to customers."
2019-01-26,RonB,4.0,we are frequent visitors to this location. always accommodating. service is good and food preparation is very consistent. we have brought many guests with us and never had a bad experience.
2019-01-26,Betty,4.0,food is always fresh and cooked well. i am disappointed that they no longer offer baked potato as a side. they make a great martini but depending on who is making it the amount they fill the glass varies. for the money they should not make a short martini.
2019-01-26,JenniferA,3.0,bathrooms are always filthy!
2019-01-21,kvk22,5.0,we had an excellent birthday dinner at legal and pam was a fantastic server. thank you for providing excellent service!
2019-01-21,durjoyace,4.0,"great quality fish, but preparation is lackluster and not worthy of the inputs.  the salad ordered was overdressed, my ""chips"" were soggy and were likely kept under the heatlamp."
2019-01-19,Iluv2travel,5.0,"legal sea foods is an icon because it serves wonderfully prepared sea food that is plentiful without overkill. the seafood is fresh and done with a light hand.  the sides work with each dish and are well prepared as well

the tables are set up for conversation. although pleasant enough it is hardly trendy looking. service is quick and knowledgeable. they cater to your needs without rushing you out the door. we got the call (daughter in law in labor) and they moved double quick to total up the bill and get us out asap.

they are a lesson to us all. do what you do best.be aware of change but keep to who you are. although legal is a known entity around these parts, they change with the times. they are constantly editing their menu. all hail legal sea foods. oh! and they serve great cocktails too"
2019-01-19,Janet9477,4.0,"the food is great. our table was basically in the dark so we couldn't even read our menus. when our waiter came with our drinks, it was too late to ask to sit at the table next to us because someone had come. i also think you should revise your appetizers.  not much to chose from except the califlower is great."
2019-01-19,herb,3.0,service has been slow and don't seem to have enough wait staff the last 2 times we have been there.
2019-01-19,JulieS,2.0,very disappointing as we had a friend of our sons in from out of town and he wanted seafood. we couldn’t get into chestnut hill where we usually go so we went to framingham. we asked the waiter which was better - steamers or mussels knowing that it’s not the best time of year for them. he recommended clams. they didn’t taste good- and a couple were bad. bar area where we sat was very cold and my husband asked the waiter to turn down the fans. asked twice and then had to go ask the host. would not go back to that location.
2019-01-19,LJSMom,5.0,"legal sea foods is consistent and never disappoints.  being january, a number of the people in the party were watching their calories.  there were choices for them and the restaurant gave options for people avoiding items like potatoes.  the halibut was outstanding."
2019-01-18,AJNYer,5.0,"best oysters anywhere, and the specials were excellent too!"
2019-01-16,CHM1,4.0,my husband and i knew we would have a quality meal at legal. we both enjoyed our dishes and were able to enjoy a leisurely meal without feeling rushed. we appreciated the care that servers offered in ensuring our meals were correct and to our liking.
2019-01-15,KarenS,5.0,"we went on tuesday, january 15th.  it was national chowder day.  legal seafoods was offering a bowl of their delicious clam chowder for $1.00 when you ordered an entree.  the chowder was excellent.  we ordered the fisherman's platter.  it came with fried clams, calamari, shrimp, cod and french fries.  was delicious and a large portion.  i would highly recommend this dish.  looking forward to a return trip."
2019-01-14,TripAdvisor,5.0,"so good, always.  another excellent meal... have had so many meals at legal i've lost track.  tonight... started with a margarita, then shrimp cocktail... steamed lobster, mashed, broccoli... desert special... bread pudding with vanilla ice cream... awesome.  bottle of french chablis.  great meal."
2019-01-13,herb,4.0,why didn't we get points for this reservation????  service was slow.
2019-01-12,RuthT,4.0,i have not received points for this reservation.  please record points as this is becoming a reoccurring issue.
2019-01-11,MarkG,5.0,"great meaal with family, legal does it right,, food was great, chowder perfect"
2019-01-10,JanP,4.0,always fresh and delicious. i have never had a bad meal at legal seafood.
2019-01-07,ChrisW,4.0,"best seafood in the area.  always fresh and great.  price seems highish, but you can't beat the quality.  miss the lazy lobster"
2019-01-07,Audrey,1.0,food was poor. manager was terrific. waiter was also terrific.
2019-01-07,DandA,1.0,initially all was well. order taken incorrectly therefore had to wait for one meal. fish undercooked when arrived. other meal had items that were cold or lukewarm. quality not good. as with friends we didn’t want to complain. enough errors were obvious. disappointing visit. it was a meal to thank friends for hosting us during our visit.
2019-01-06,ChuckP,4.0,"the four of us had a very pleasant lunch. we arrived at 12:30 and left at 2:45 pm. we were able to order our food and eat at a leisurely pace while catching up on our lives. the light levels were good, the noise levels were under control and our wait person was extremely accomodating."
2019-01-06,ELLENH,5.0,had an excellent dinner. everything was so delicious and hot and service was excellent.
2019-01-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great dinner with my husband. food was fresh and delicious and cocktails were tasty.
2019-01-06,TryNewPlaces,5.0,we have eaten here many times. the food is always delicious and the service excellent. we will come back again.
2019-01-06,Kenkoh,4.0,by far the most consistent in terms of good service and decent food in this area. our server carlos was amazing.  very caring and attentive. managers patrick and kevin are great. it was a great experience from start to finish. the highlights were fresh oysters followed by cioppino.
2019-01-06,JessicaM,5.0,"this is our favorite legal sea foods location. the food is always high quality, the service is excellent, and we really enjoy the building and environment. i highly recommend reservations, there can be quite a long wait during dinnertime, though things do quiet down during non-peak times."
2019-01-06,Robert,5.0,legal never disappoints.  always start with the chowda.. seafood specials and flights of wine.. all were great...
2019-01-02,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was as always, attentive and effective.  all of our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to us timely.  happy new year to everyone at legal sea foods in framingham!  y.s. kim"
2018-12-31,EvaK,5.0,even though it was new years eve the food and service was exceptional
2018-12-31,KrisR,5.0,great service and excellent food on a very busy night. thanks again for making our dining experience memorable for family.
2018-12-31,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"we were out to celebrate new year’s eve. we had a 615 reservation. we were seated in the lounge 30 minutes late. when we were shown to our table ,  two place settings were oily from the drawn butter that the previous guests had had with their lobster. my husband ordered the fried fisherman‘s platter and half of the fish was cold. very disappointing. legal is one of our favorite places to eat and enjoy with friends. again, very disappointed."
2018-12-31,Locavore,5.0,food is consistently good and the service is very professional.
2018-12-31,isabel,5.0,my friends and i go to legal in framingham every new year's eve primarily for the baked stuffed lobster.  it is always delish!
2018-12-31,CynthiaC,5.0,"we can count on legal seafood for consistently delicious food, fantastic service (our waiter gus was attentive and friendly) and great atmosphere. 
my blackened swordfish was cooked just the way i requested it (mildly hot spices ) and my husband enjoyed every bite of his blackened tuna.
the restaurant was very busy as it was new year’s eve but we never felt rushed.  
overall our  dinner at legal was as good as it can be!"
2018-12-31,FinnB,1.0,our reservations were at 5:30. we were sat immediately. the server came and once we told him we were not drinking alcohol or ordering apps it seemed we were totally ignored the rest of the night. we sat with a dinner roll and seltzer waiting for our salad for 1 hr. at 6:30pm we finally received our salad. others around us had already received their meals. we had to inquire how much longer for our meal at 7pm. our meal wasn't complicated. wife order tuna sashimi and shrimp cocktail for her meal. husband ordered tuna steak everything dinner. waiter never came back to see how our meal was when we finally received it. very disappointed in the evening and the clear disinterest in us for not getting appetizers and cocktails on ny eve to up our bill. total disappointment - for an early ny dinner.
2018-12-31,OpenTable Diner,5.0,new year’s eve
2018-12-31,StatLady,5.0,"wonderful food and service, great atmosphere to celebrate the new year."
2018-12-30,DebbieC,5.0,never disappoints...incredible service...incredible food...wonderful atmosphere. i am asking myself why we don't eat here more often.
2018-12-29,Helga,3.0,"we’re frequent patrons of legal sea foods in framingham. we’re both very good cooks and therefore rather demanding; we go there because in general the food is reliable and once in a while, very good. this time the grilled shrimp was delicious and so was the grilled scallops. our grandson’s cheeseburger was brought to the table with no cheese. he summoned his courage to call the waitress. the ketchup bottle was empty. again, he had to get a waitress’s attention which is not easy when the restaurant is busy. 

our grand daughter’s serving of cod was miniscule but she liked the taste. the waitress forgot my husband’s wine. service  was friendly with plenty of smiles and “no problem!” but slow and rather distracted."
2018-12-29,DavidW,5.0,"the restaurant has good sized tables and they are not too close together.  the restaurant was full but we always felt comfortable and could easily talk during the meal.  our server was outstanding, the food was high quality.  everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed our night."
2018-12-29,WayneG,4.0,"the service was excellent and the food was very delicious and the portion size was ample. 
the salmon and haddock was very good. i had the fried whole belly clams and they were tasty but had a couple of tough clams which is probably due to the seasonality. 

we will be be back for sure."
2018-12-29,TomL,5.0,great food. service is always good. pretty good beer and wine list.
2018-12-29,matthewH,2.0,i was very disappointed that legal has dropped baked potatoes from their menu.  the mashed potatoes are horrible.  loaded with skins and too much salt.  this is the only seafood restaurant that doesn’t have baked potatoes.  i suggest that corporate reconsider this poorly thought out decision.
2018-12-29,MarekM,3.0,"the food was generally ok, but grilled vegetables were actually burnt, not to our taste. 
service wasn’t great either, waitress not very friendly."
2018-12-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"always a great meal here.  tonight we enjoyed salads, crab cakes, bang bang cauliflower, fried shrimp, and steamed lobsters.  awesome!"
2018-12-28,Bestrestaurant,5.0,manager was terrific in accommodating where we wanted to be seated. server was awesome. food was consistently great!
2018-12-27,Denbrook,5.0,"always a pleasure to enjoy a fine meal here, especially on our 56th wedding anniversary."
2018-12-27,Ackman,4.0,"i visited legal seafood on a thursday with a group of six for a holiday lunch.  we chose legal due to its location, ability to reserve a a table and their consistently good fish dishes.  the restaurant did not disappoint as everyone enjoyed their meals which were delivered promptly and were of excellent quality.

for appetizers we had raw oysters and calamari.  both were excellent.  i had the fisherman's stew which was also very good and the feedback from the other diners was also very positive.

i like legal for all the reasons above but be prepared to pay a little extra if you go."
2018-12-27,DL18,5.0,"legal sea foods is our favorite spot for getting together and having a fabulous meal.  the entire experience, start to finish, is outstanding.  food is exceptionally fresh and always delicious. our waiter was truly awesome, attentive, thoughtful and knowledgeable...and never did we feel rushed.  we highly recommend legal sea foods for a consistently delicious, fun dining experience."
2018-12-27,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was friendly, efficient, and effective.  our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to us timely.  happy new year!"
2018-12-27,Bostonfinner,4.0,"this legal’s is very consistent.  food is always well prepared.  wait staff is knowledgeable, attentive and pleasant.  we are frequent diners (several times/month) and have been since inman square in the 70’s!  sergei is a very good waiter."
2018-12-25,SariS,3.0,"the food was wonderful and our waitress was very nice.  however, we did not appreciate having the clean up staff trying to sweep under our feet as we are eating.  there was no need for this intrusiveness.  we felt rushed and as though they wanted us to leave.  our reservation was at 6:45 pm.  clearly, the restaurant was not closing.  there must be a better way for the staff to get other tables ready without disturbing customers who are eating and trying to enjoy their meal.  we were there for a special occasion, and this ruined the experience.  next time, we will go elsewhere."
2018-12-25,StephenL,4.0,the polenta with my artic char was very strange. it was not real fried polenta. i like polenta with butter and cheese and warm right out of the pot or cooled and fried same day. my artic char was fine and the nice feature of sauce of your choice gives it an added flavor twist to your taste and mood. i would recommend this restaurant for good seafood.
2018-12-25,JonathanB,4.0,"went for our annual christmas dinner.  the food was prepared well.  all plates came out hot and fresh and everyone's entrees were well received.  our order consisted of salmon, trout, fried haddock and a steak..  sides are a bit more interesting than in the past visits

only two comments:  
1.  waiter was inattentive, forgot a drink order and water glasses were not refilled as needed.  i never expect to reach the end of a meal with empty water glasses

2.  would like to see more vegetables in the side salad.  only tomatoes, carrots and sunflower seeds.  it's mostly just a lot of greens.  given the price, would like to have seen more vegetable variety."
2018-12-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"as a family who does take out from here  about every other week (due to a small child’ at home), we really enjoy our christmas outing to this restaurant. food and drinks are always consistently delicious! we love being recognized by one of the managers (i wish i remembered her name!), she always comes by to say hello and reminisce with us about holidays past. thank you for being a part of our holiday traditions, especially when it means sacrificing your own for us!"
2018-12-25,SusanK,4.0,"my party of 3 enjoyed a late afternoon dinner on christmas day. legal sea foods was one of very few places open on the holiday, so they were very busy, and we were glad of our reservation. food was great, as expected. service was excellent, even through the ""full house"" craziness. my only lower marks are for the ambiance, as the environment was very noisy, making conversation difficult. (this is true of this location, framingham, even when it is not busy and playing holiday music, because of the ""industrial"" acoustics.)"
2018-12-25,Cunningham,2.0,"don't eat here on a holiday (christmas). the place was mobbed.  they honored my 2:15 reservation, but stuffed us into the side room with tables too close together and a low ceiling that amplified the noise. the entree specials were boring; one was a salad (outside temp 32 f).  the noise level was so stressful i asked for the check as soon as i gave up finishing the entree. very disappointed by this visit, although i have been a regular customer in the past."
2018-12-25,CatherineC,3.0,"disappointing christmas dinner. legal has been our go-to place for special occasions, but after this experience i'm not sure we'll return to the framingham location. we both had the grilled assortment. all the shrimp were overdone. the carrots so underdone they needed a serrated knife to cut them. the chef's choice for me was 2 pieces of salmon and one of tuna. my husband had 3 varieties of fish which is what the menu indicates. we've had this same meal before (christmas 2017 in framingham and thanksgiving 2017 and 2018 in chestnut hill) and it has always been excellent. not sure what happened but it was memorable, and not in a good way."
2018-12-25,GeeJay,5.0,this is a really great place to eat. good food and excellent service.
2018-12-25,HWilliams,5.0,"a great meal at christmas, seafood wonderful, and nice beef, and good food for the vegetarian too. nice service by tyler. thanks"
2018-12-24,MartinA,4.0,the food is always good! and never skip the oysters
2018-12-24,irepra,5.0,we were at legal christmas eve with family from california and had a great meal with very accommodating staff. we especially appreciated the accommodation made for the 14 month old. it is always a special treat to go to legal seafood.
2018-12-23,JoanneT,5.0,we had the best waiter....gus!  he made the whole meal feel very special and was attentive to our every need.
2018-12-21,nancyl,4.0,"fantastic seafood. excellent service.  the standards are very high throughout all their many locations.  my one criticism of the natick restaurant is that it is very loud, making it difficult to hear other s speak when there with a large group."
2018-12-20,Maggie,5.0,wonderful experience all around - our waitress alissa was exceptional!! just perfect - thank you
2018-12-16,MtWashingonInnVacay,5.0,"we go to legal in framigham every year on my birthday.  this year we started off with the treasures of the reef appetizer., combo of oysters, cherrystones, cooked shrimp and half a lobster tail.     i always get the baked stuffed lobster, yum, it's soo good. sides were fingerling potato's and broccoli.. very good.  my husband always gets the fisherman's platter.. huge. this year it was fried to perfection.. nice, crisp and light breading.    since it was my birthday legal gave us my choice of dessert free of charge.  we brought it home.. that chocolate cake was delish!"
2018-12-16,EMCove,5.0,we are always greeted and treated in a first class manner.  the menu never disappoints whatever we order.  thank you for being so dependable!   elizabeth cove.
2018-12-16,SheilaC,3.0,disappointing. very slow for an uncrowded dinner seating. two of three items for a dinner plate not available.
2018-12-16,LamartineB,3.0,service was good what my wife's food was good except mine for the price  what i paid  it was not  worth it they  should of dress up plate better .
2018-12-15,Seafoodie,5.0,service was superb!  legal’s is always reliable for an excellent dining experience!
2018-12-15,Janet,5.0,"went to legals for hubby's birthday but go out to dinner often. whenever we want seafood, legals is one of our favorites. waiter was great. when you asked to substitute (son wanted rice instead of butternut squash) or if you didn't want this or that, (father-in-law) waiter didn't make you feel bad. ""sure, no problem."" excellent service. only downside is the restaurant is always busy so it's not always relaxing or easy to hear for older folks. other than that, food is always great as is service. they certainly know what they are doing."
2018-12-15,twinjules,3.0,"thank goodness for the oysters and cherrystones! they were simply amazing. as far as our meals, the tuna overdone ,& sashimi was very salty. service was just fair, waitress dropped off menus and began to turn to walk away without even taking a drink order. when she finally decided to return with our drinks, it was like we had put her out because the tap was evidently not working properly. we understand that it is a very busy time of year, that being said, we were not as pleased with this past visit. will give it another try at some point"
2018-12-14,ElizabethW,5.0,wonderful meal and great service.
2018-12-14,MarkS,5.0,excellent food quality and attentive wait staff. atmosphere is good and noise level was acceptable. highly recommend this restaurant
2018-12-13,DavidJ,5.0,"waiter tom was friendly, knowledgeable, and engaging.  we very much enjoyed interacting with him, and he provided excellent service. 

food highlights for us were the fried clams and clam chowder.  both are about the best we remember having.

all the other food we had was very good.  the ingredients were fresh and high quality.

personally,  i would like to see more healthier options on the menu, especially for sides.  i know legal probably offers what sells in their market, but i just love the taste of fresh, high quality ingredients without a lot of sauce sometimes.  overall, we had a great experience."
2018-12-09,NicholasP,5.0,have been there many times and always have an excellent experience! the food quality is outstanding and the service is always excellent.  i always start with raw oysters as the choice and quality are second to none!
2018-12-08,Hudsontravelers,4.0,this was a special occasion birthday dinner for a friend. the reservation included birthday. we arrived and were seated with in a few minutes to a nice table. i quietly mentioned to the hostess that this was a special birthday celebration and wanted a surprise with dessert. i also mentioned we had concert tickets in natick so needed to leave by a certain time. they smiled reassuringly. the waitress was pleasant and eager to please...read the specials with animation and took our order efficiently. she pronounced thermidor as theodore but we said nothing...thought it was cute. the meals were excellent as usual. desserts arrived without fanfare or even a candle or acknowledgement. we left quite disappointed and i mentioned it to the hostess when we left. she remembered my request and sincerely apologized. legal sea food is truly a special occasion restaurant but not last night.
2018-12-08,SanO,5.0,our party of four was seated in a small room off the large dining room. we were able to easily converse with one another. everyone's food was delicious and our server was friendly and attentive.

2018-12-05,TomM,3.0,"fried calamari appetizer was delicious, tender and not greasy.  the halibut was good, standard with mashed potato.  arctic char was also fine. the chocolate pudding cake with ice cream was a
good. the meal was nothing exceptional.  i have eaten better halibut by far. it was veryy noisy. service was great."

2018-11-28,DeborahG,4.0,"the cioppino used to come with jasmine rice but not anymore. the size of the meal is smaller also. very tasty but for $33 they could at least give you the rice. 
felt a little rushed also. 
the quality of the food was excellent though."
2018-11-27,JohnM,5.0,great food and the service was outstanding!
2018-11-26,TripAdvisor,5.0,"i love legal seafoods.  great chow, libation, service, in a nice atmosphere.  what's not to like.  always consistent... so good.  tonight a house salad with peppercorn dressing... baked stuffed shrimp with mashed potatoes.  service from tom... excellent, as usual... professional and attentive."
2018-11-26,YSKim,5.0,"our server tyler was friendly, accommodating, efficient and professional.  our meals were prepared to our exact orders and delivered to our table efficiently.  happy holidays to tyler and staff members at legal sea foods in framingham, ma!  y.s. kim"
2018-11-23,tron781,3.0,"i love this place, my wife and i go here routinely and the food is always great.

one thing i've noticed though is the packaging of the leftovers aleays leak.  everytime without fail something leaks in the bag, filling it with whatever liquid was in that specific meal, costing all of the containers.  it's a bummer, the little tinfoil containers just don't do the job.

this particular visit my food was wonderful, but a little off frpm what i ordered.  as always i asked for no shrimp in my baked seafood casserole, i got a bunch.  i was given ample scallops which were magnificent, but i hate shrimp. 

the side room where we sat gets loud pretty quickly so i won't take a seat in there again

don't get me wrong the food is amazing, you will not be disappointed, it just seems with the volume of holiday traffic coming in that the experience is taking a ding"

2018-11-22,HalB,5.0,"we went to legal seafoods for thanksgiving.  our waiter was truly excellent, providing one of the best experiences we've had in quite a while.  although they did have a turkey dinner available as a special, we all went with seafood choices.  as has been the case for decades, the chowder was a treat.  my mother enjoyed her clam chowder while i happily went for the fish chowder.  my wife went for a shrimp cocktail instead.  she's picky about her shrimp and raved about these.  lobster, crab cake, and scallops were all excellent."
2018-11-22,jackojacko,4.0,"we did not expect such a large thanksgiving crowd! food was excellent, service was excellent, and really as good as it could be under the circumstances. noise level was moderate, which is very surprising given size of crowd. gluten-free: i must have gluten free food. our waiter personally checked with the chef, and made sure that the meal i ordered was gluten-free. despite the crowded conditions, all in all a very nice thanksgiving dinner!

recommendations: i try not to make recommendations, under any circumstances. this place is perhaps a little expensive for a casual lunch or a date. the restaurant has many gluten-free options, and the wait staff appear to be well informed about these options and their limitations."
2018-11-22,bobm,4.0,"great food, pricey"
2018-11-22,EB10,5.0,"overall excellent, although it was a very busy thanksgiving day!"
2018-11-22,SharonC,5.0,"we loved the food, the wait staff was wonderful. this was a repeat visit and there will be more."
2018-11-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,excellent as always.  very busy but they do a good job of managing a crowd
2018-11-22,MossH,3.0,"excellant service. there were 6 of us. 3 had the thanksgiving special which they all enjoyed. 1 vegetarian very disappointed with the lack of even basic options. the fried clams were very good though they were served on top of french fries and  onion rings, both very soggy. not really edible. for a busy holiday service was excellent with a very attentive waitress. i have been dining at legal for many years. it is always consistent, though the food, at least at this location, has dropped from excellent to good in recent visits."
2018-11-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,last minute option for thanksgiving turned out to be a great meal. hearty portions and great service!
2018-11-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we were disappointed that baked potato was off the menu again.
2018-11-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent meal as always
2018-11-18,WilliamW,5.0,"consistently very good seafood, always fresh. they take gluten free requests very seriously, which is required if you have celiac disease... gives me peace of mind."
2018-11-18,Medda,3.0,"i dine here often. the last visit was meh at best. service was excellent, wait staff very accommodating. food,  not as good. the vegetables, carrots, beets were chunky and raw, very difficult to eat, not cooked. the grilled shrimp, overcooked. just not what it usually is, so for me, disappointing. it's not an inexpensive meal so it should be at least cooked, not over or under. very disappointing this time."
2018-11-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"anniversary dinner. everything was amazing. our waitress stacey g was awesome. she was there anytime we needed her, but not too much.  the pace of the food coming was perfect.

i’ll recommend that location legal sea foods to all my friends and family."
2018-11-16,TrishT,4.0,great seafood.  quick and friendly service.  good selections on menu.
2018-11-16,MikhailS,4.0,it would be nice if the restaurant brought back baked potato as a side dish and had at least one or two vegetarian options in the menu.
2018-11-15,Easterbrunchfor4,5.0,the waiter was very attentive and the food was excellent!
2018-11-11,RogerR,5.0,good food. attentive and efficient service. plenty of parking.
2018-11-10,Janet,4.0,"we booked an early dinner (5:45) so we had plenty of time to chat with our friends before an 8:00 movie. we kept laughing that we would be eating with all the seniors. just the opposite, we were seated in the bar area and next to us were a few tables of families. probably hungry after a day of shopping.  the bar was hopping so it was quite loud which is fun... but made chatting with our friends a little more challenging. we were going to move but thought it was crowded everywhere so we made the best of it. per usual, our food and service was great. never had a bad meal at legals."
2018-11-10,bararn,5.0,"our waitress was outstanding, attentive, and followed up on everything."
2018-11-10,papadoc,4.0,"food, service, ambience all great.  unfortunately, ventilation needs improvement.  we noticed a fish smell in the restaurant and could still smell fish on our clothes when we arrived home 2 hours later.  we have enjoyed dinner at several l. s. restaurants and have never had that experience before."
2018-11-10,DfromNewton,5.0,"we are frequent diners.  i love their flexibility with special requests. the h
food is delicious and the servers are all really nice.   they are open late"
2018-11-07,BenO,4.0,"food was a bit oily and a little overpriced.  i would have had the chowder, but it was $7.50 for just a cup!

i had requested a special booth for our anniversary, but the hostess sat us wherever was open, rips in the booth seats, in the middle of the restaurant.  i guess they don't read the comment section of the reservation?

however - the service was top notch.  carlos was incredibly engaging, and he made our night seem special anyway, including a free dessert.  thanks carlos!

i'll definitely go back, but i hope they drop their prices just a bit and use slightly less oil in all dishes."
2018-11-07,ThomasS,4.0,"good reliable seafood option.  service (taking order) was a bit slow, but completely within acceptable bounds.  food came quickly.  very tasty scallops and salad."
2018-11-04,Westernmass,5.0,always the best. our server was friendly and very engaging. we had a great night.
2018-11-03,Bottomline222,3.0,we have been coming since the opened first in natick and the current location. in general the food is good and sometimes excellent. today was a fair-good day. the trout was over cooked and the kitchen covered it up with privencial style vegetables. eatable but i would have sent it back but my wife didn’t want too. the manager came over and said it comes out different all the time. still over cooked. my sole was good but had no sauce. we’ll be back but not as fast as we would be.
2018-11-03,DebbieM,5.0,"you can always depend on legal seafood to be high quality and delicious. the grilled haddock is my go-to, although i do miss the baked potato. my husband almost always gets the chowder. might sound odd to point out the iced tea, but it's consistently good (brewed, unsweetened with lemon). outstanding service, and it's nice to be able to make a reservation on open table."
2018-11-02,Ballou,5.0,"one of the best values is legal’s luncheon fish sandwich with your choice of two sides. you get a generous piece of haddock, tomato, lettuce, on a toasted bun.  i choose my favorite sides of polenta and butternut squash. traditional sides of fries, cole slaw, as well as steamed broccoli with cheese, are available. you can’t beat the price of under $15. top off your meal with a “lighter “ desert of legal’s ice cream bon-bons. be sure to ask for a booth and chad. great service and value-can’t beat legal in framingham!"
2018-11-01,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal always delivers.  we love coming here and do so often.  top quality chow, nice wines, excellent service, comfortable atmosphere... what's not to like?  my house salad with creamy peppercorn dressing... simple but perfect.  blackened halibut served with mashed potatoes... awesome.  wish they'd bring back baked potatoes, but will survive.  excellent service, as usual.  so good!"
2018-10-31,LeilaC,2.0,"legal has become overpriced for the quality of the food. the service and decor are still great, but the food is not. it's become chain food similar to tgi friday's for seafood but the prices are that of an upscale restaurant. 
if i'm going to pay for upscale dining, i will go somewhere where the quality of the food is better. there are plenty of options."
2018-10-30,stewartk,5.0,excellent service
2018-10-29,SweetSue,5.0,"we are regulars because legal is always ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.  our server was chad, and he was terrific.  i can eat delicious gluten free meals without fear as legal takes this seriously.  there is a wonderful variety of gf food available.  everything from oysters to veggies to all seafood is fresh & beautifully prepared.

my husband & i split a huge salad and each enjoyed an entree that we ended up bringing home & finishing the next night for dinner.  it’s rare to find such high quality food in such generous quantities."
2018-10-28,Ballou,5.0,judy is the best. salmon with polenta and butternut squash plus boston cream pie. great booth and tremendous service. can’t beat legal in framingham!
2018-10-28,TheodoraG,5.0,"legals' always does a great job!  the ambience is up beat, our server was wonderful - very attentive.  food was delicious - we had some fantastic mussels, baked stuffed lobster, and they even catered to my brother who pretty much asked for a custom meal.  we enjoyed my mom's birthday, and they brought her dessert out with a candle.  thank you legal in framingham!"
2018-10-27,TamBam,5.0,"we made a reservation on open table for a party of 6. i noted upon reserving that one of the couples was celebrating their wedding anniversary, and asked to have champagne brought to them upon arrival. they flawlessly executed my request and the couple was so surprised. our waiter was amazing, and allowed us to take our time and enjoy our group dinner without rushing us through ordering or making us feel like he was busy. the food as always was incredible (highly recommend the bang bang cauliflower app and the halibut steak)."
2018-10-27,Eliot,5.0,"legal seafood always delivers! we visit regularly. food and atmosphere were world class, keep it up!"
2018-10-27,CIAFoodie,5.0,out with friends for a lovely evening.

2018-10-25,Lincolnite,5.0,"loved it, especially our server, pam, who was attentive and kind. delicious food as always. great bottle of wine."
2018-10-22,jsands222,5.0,went for lunch. both food and service were exceptional.  even brought complementary bon bond for my wife’s birthday. nice touch.
2018-10-21,Shari,5.0,our waiter was super nice and patient. food and special accommodations great as always.
2018-10-20,Foodie,5.0,"great seafood and fantastic service for someone with significant dietary restrictions. they were both careful and happy to accommodate. we've been going here for years in large part because they take the dietary restrictions seriously and don't make you feel bad for having them. we ordered the lobster bake, which was fantastic!"
2018-10-20,LindaS,5.0,good food as usual and comfortable setting. also very pleasant server.
2018-10-18,TripAdvisor,5.0,"shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, house salad w/peppercorn dressing... lobster, fried shrimp... all great.  love coming here!"
2018-10-18,OpenTable Diner,4.0,as expected for legal seafood
2018-10-17,PaulO,5.0,very good sezfood.  excellent service.  almost as good as the union oyster house in boston
2018-10-17,Ballou,5.0,great service as always. our server was quick with delivery and the food was delicious. we both have a luncheon salmon with different sides. i had polenta and butternut squash and my wife had broccoli and polenta we finished off the mail at boston cream pie – delicious!
2018-10-15,RaymondN,5.0,"as always with legal, superior food and fondly service.  our server bryan was particularly accommodating to my 88 year old dad, helping him remove the meat from his lobster shell, and singing along to celebrate his birthday."
2018-10-14,RichardF,4.0,"i have been to a few legal sea foods locations. this was my first time in framingham. the quality of the food at legal sea foods is quite good, but because it is expensive i can only afford it on rare occasions. my wife and i both had the grilled arctic char and it was excellent. my only comment is that for the price, the size of the fillet was disappointingly small. there was a special dessert, a caramel apple tart with vanilla ice cream and this was probably the best dessert i have ever had at legal.   the service was excellent. one suggestion i have about the way the menu is printed: several entrees are listed with what appear to be two set sides. fortunately i asked our server about this and he said we could have our choice of two sides, and we were both happy with that as neither of us wanted the sides listed with the arctic char. i was also disappointed that snap peas are no longer offered, as that has been my favorite legal side.  the noise level might have been a little high and the server might not have properly heard my wife's choice of sides, because it came with one side wrong, but this mistake was corrected in less than two minutes."
2018-10-13,EdmondJ,5.0,the service is always above the normal. the waiter was knowledgeable and pleasant
2018-10-13,Rbrook,4.0,"way too over priced....food is very very good and fresh, but it is so over priced for the food.....my daughter and i went after the movies. no drinks...i had a salad and appetizer as a dinner and she had trout with a cup of soup...it was over $75 with tip. the appetizer was shrimp wontons for $12 and only had 4 wontons. only 2 had a shrimp in it. never again unless i get a gift card. sorry but that is way i feel. i am not cheap and like spending $ on quality food, but this was ridiculous."
2018-10-13,DLsfavorite,3.0,"i had seafood casserole.   no lobster pieces to be found.  also needed more bread crumbs.
the carrots were hard yellow and uncooked.  waiter brought sauté spinach as substitute.
it too was not cooked enough and unappealing.
usually have very good meals here.  not tonight."
2018-10-13,JaimeM,5.0,the service and management were amazing! they went above and beyond when an issue arrived.
2018-10-13,Jblk,4.0,"we regularly take our grandchildren to legal. service is quick , the children's menu is good , and grownups can get nice fresh fish."
2018-10-13,JonathanC,5.0,great service. never had to ask for anything -- it was anticipated and brought to me. great food.
2018-10-13,RONALD,4.0,great food and very good service. only issue for me was the strong fish odour which hits you as you enter the reception area. otherwise all 5 stars😁
2018-10-10,JOHNB,5.0,server was great and was very attentive without being over bearing.  excellent meeting place.
2018-10-09,GablesGirlLikesHerFood,3.0,"table bread, which used to be a highlight of the meal, was stale and reheated. $7 cup of chowder was underwhelming. oysters were good but it's hard to mess up raw oysters. entrees tasted okay but didn't seem worth the price. i had an almond crusted salmon which i asked to be cooked medium-rare but came out well-done."
2018-10-09,gigi,5.0,why did we not get our 100 points? this is a favorite spot for us and the restaurant on query said it ed was an ot issue and that they confirmed our arrival!
2018-10-08,redwine,3.0,"food was reliably good. service was awful.  first, our party of 6 adults were seated in a cramped booth. when we asked to move, they took us to a table and asked the folks there to move (can you say uncomfortable?). we were eventually seated at the round table we requested as we walked in. service was slow and dinners arrived while appetizer plates remained uncleared, forcing the servers to try juggling. at the close, plates were stacked in front of several of us (yuck!)."
2018-10-08,TripAdvisor,5.0,"back for more excellent chow.  tonight, house salads and then a lobster and fried shrimp... all perfect.  excellent service."
2018-10-08,tennisgroup,5.0,"we were a group of long time tennis friends having a yearly get=together dinner.  we had lovely table in pleasant room, wonderful food and outstanding service from a terrific wait person.  the date was monday october 8th and reservation was 5 pm in blue room for 7.  cannot remember the name of our server, but would love to be able praise him for a job well done."
2018-10-07,JackF,5.0,good service and food.  thank u for a great time. what else do u want me to say...
2018-10-06,Bostoncouple1,4.0,"great service
reliably tasty food"
2018-10-06,Eattoomuch,3.0,"have been here many times... service was fair, much too long for getting clam chowder and completing the order. we were in a back room that was originally fine, but became too cold once tables were leaving. i had a sea bass special.. very dry. had to add something for flavor."
2018-10-06,PaulG,4.0,reservations not really honored-they must have missed our name as after waiting we finally approached the desk and -oh oh!!  plenty of open booths when we were final seated--waiter lost out as he never asked us if we wanted a drink or app- just offered chowder to my husband- i  as all set to order a caesar salad but never had the chance- i would like to have had that as my husband enjoyed his chowder- it is a 45 minute drive for us-so we most likely will not be returning-
2018-10-06,CarolA,5.0,everything was delicious. waiter was attentive. all good
2018-10-06,Cynthia,4.0,"another pleasant afternoon spent at legal!

2018-10-02,Dkat,5.0,tristan was our server and he was personable & knowledgeable.

2018-09-28,ElizabethW,5.0,wonderful meal and terrific service.  the waiter couldn’t have been more helpful.
2018-09-28,LoraL,4.0,the food was good and the service was very good as well but half of the small room was taken by a large party and we could not converse or speak to the server.
2018-09-27,TripAdvisor,5.0,"house salad, cherrystones, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp... all excellent tonight.  wish they still had baked potatoes... had mashed.  margaritas and sonoma cutrer.  fine service from brittany and judy."
2018-09-27,MichaelG,4.0,brought my daughter and granddaughter. granddaughter got sick all over the table 10 min in. staff jumped into action cleaning up getting my food packed to go with new salads. professional packed and no big deal.  always outstanding food and service. can’t get better seafood anywhere. they defined the quality standards years ago. bread used to be good . not anymore. 4.9 stars out of 5
2018-09-26,TonyP,5.0,consistently well prepared food and excellent service
2018-09-25,FrequentDiner,3.0,"overcrowded on a weekday, overpriced, noisy. food ok, but there are other options these days."
2018-09-22,Susan32,3.0,"we've had many enjoyable family meals at legal sea foods in framingham, but have noticed the past few times that the food and service were not quite up to par. i think the reason for the variation is that it all depends on the server. there is one server in particular who's really great, but the others do not seem to be on top of their game. at the same time, the menu choices are narrowing further and further while the prices continue to increase. this is a problem company-wide, not at this particular branch, though legal crossing in downtown boston has an innovative menu. it may also be that there are not enough wait staff, so each server is too overworked to be able to give the tables proper attention. for example, our appetizers remained uncleared for at least 20 minutes, up until the main course arrived, and the drinks didn't arrive until after the appetizers. i'm not even sure anyone asked us if everything was alright after the main courses did arrive. we may have to pass on this long-time favorite the next time we have something to celebrate with our family."
2018-09-22,SandyB,5.0,i always enjoy the food is exactly the way it is described and always consistently good.
2018-09-21,DebS,2.0,"we dine at legal seafood on a regular basis.  not always this location.
tonights dinner was unusually poor.  we sat in the bar area at a high top table and were waited on by two different servers.  unfortunately, they were not in sync with each other.  our starters (salad and steamed mussels) took 30 minutes to arrive.  this was only after checking in with the second waiter.  it appears as though they were never ordered.  shortly thereafter the first waiter disappeared for the rest of the evening.  the garlic and shrimp entree was as expected, however, the lobster roll had barely any lobster in it.  certainly not worth the price we were charged.

we will not rush back to this location any time soon."
2018-09-21,michelec,3.0,"my husband and i attended the opening of legal in chestnut hill years ago. it has remained quite good over the years. our service was excellent, my dinner, grilled shrimp with jalapeño polenta was also excellent. my husband loves fried clams, so once a summer he orders them. the clams and batter were extremely tasty, however, they were soggy. this is why i gave our overall rating a ""good"" not very good."
2018-09-20,ChrisR,3.0,"unfortunately my wife's halibut was undercooked to the point that it was raw in the middle. it wasn't a big deal, she sent it back.  when the plate finally came back, well after i was finished eating, the fish was overcooked and dry. the waitress couldn't have been more apologetic about the situation it was the manger. we patronize legal sea food/c-bar quite frequently and will continue to do so. my scallops were cooked perfectly."
2018-09-19,TripAdvisor,5.0,"why do i love legal so much... because i always feel awesome when i leave, having had a great meal, excellent service, nice libation, served in a nice atmosphere.  my margarita was perfect... odd, i know, but they are excellent here.  salad, baked stuffed shrimp, baby carrots.  the killer blueberry tart with vanilla ice cream for dessert."
2018-09-16,Keith,5.0,"great food, and great service. we sat in the bar area and had some drinks, clam chowder, and seafood broil platter [forget the name of it]. it was a great portion with a solid variety of good seafood."
2018-09-15,DonaldB,4.0,went there specifically for the oyster festival. fantastic; might go again. i highly recommend going before it ends 10/10. what i didn't care for was the choice of music. it was pounding and not conducive to a relaxing dinner.
2018-09-15,PhilV,4.0,"excellent, aside from not receiving points on open table because they sat us in the bar."
2018-09-14,Ballou,5.0,the host desk was very accommodating given how busy they were. we were able to sit at our favorite table even though we were 20 minutes early. the salmon was delicious as always. we really enjoyed the seasonal carrots! our server was prompt and responsive. the hostess even came by to check on us! legal seafood in framingham is top notch -even on a crowded day.
2018-09-14,PaulC,5.0,our waiter was outstanding!!  the appetizer and food were so good!  this outing made our evening!
2018-09-12,MarthaB,5.0,"i have eaten at several legal seafoods over the years. this one was outstanding from friendly greeting, nice table, good menu and food. most especially, our server was friendly and recognized immediately that we were catching up with old friends. she gave us all the time we could want to visit no feeling of being rushed at all. 
this is a consistently good restaurant and the framingham location is attractive and inviting."
2018-09-12,Joanie,3.0,ordered the greek salad - very disappointing.  old and soggy greens - too much dressing.  is one of my favorite restaurants past its prime?
2018-09-08,Mrlowpost,3.0,"we have had the fried calamari on numerous occasions.  this time arrived very oily and greasy. 
also initially they wanted to seat us in the noisy “board room “ area even though many other tables were available for 2 people. we asked to be changed."
2018-09-08,CassieF,5.0,"our server, brian (sp?), was fanatastic.  very attentive to our large group and always available to answer questions, but never pushy.  the food was so good and came out quickly so we weren't waiting around between courses.  i would definitely come back and i hope our server gets some sort of commendation because he was truly amazing and really made our experience."
2018-09-07,Jimthecook,4.0,"fish (halibut fir me) very fresh and perfectly cooked as always. vegetable sides fresh, but maybe a bit too simple. a vast pile of roasted mushrooms with no notable seasoning, and mashed potatoes. 
service great- our server happily dissected my date’s lobster for him, and was there when we needed her.
i’m sorry they felt the need to pull out the carpet sweepers and race around the room while we were still dining.
expensive, as always- halibut with mashed potatoes and under seasoned mushrooms were $32.95...
good for an out-of-town guest who wanted oysters and lobster, but only for special occasions."
2018-09-06,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another great meal.  chowder, cherrystones, shrimp cocktail all excellent.  today's special app was great... scallops and sausage on a bed of greens.  my blackened halibut was perfect.  legal just stopped serving baked potatoes, so had mashed... very good.  nice drinks and vino.  great service"
2018-09-06,RDEllenG,4.0,"legal is our stand by, always good food for fresh seafood.  well prepared, hot and fresh food with friendly service.  not fancy, just comfortable."
2018-09-05,PattyP,4.0,"delicious, innovative and fresh seafood! the scallops and chorico appetizer was new to the menu and fantastic."
2018-09-03,Suzjohn44,5.0,best fried clams!  usually order other things but these were amazing. the martini was really good too
2018-09-02,RuthT,5.0,"our server, carlos, made an extra effort to be sure i had a wine i liked by bringing me a sample.  he has helped us before and is always pleasant and enthusiastic about making our experience positive !!  we eat at 
legal in framingham frequently."
2018-09-02,NatickDiner,4.0,dinner was very good. the menu prices are getting to be high. dinners have gone from the low $20s to $30($29.99 and above) in just past two years.  definitely $100 dinner for 2
2018-09-01,HC70,5.0,"legal's doesn't miss  - excellent seafood in a friendly, casual atmosphere.  as good as it gets for seafood in the boston area!!!"
2018-09-01,YSKim,5.0,"our server nelson was courteous, attentive and effective.  all of our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to us timely.  manager kevin dropped by our table to say hello and treated us with 6 bon bons.  thanks, everyone!"

haddock was extremely salty.
for the price, i should have sent it back."
2018-08-29,Artanis,1.0,"hostesses seated us and gave us the menus and we waited for the server. sergey had a lot of tables. he breezed by and said he'd be right back. well, his right back was more than 5 minutes, most of which he spent kibitzing with a table of 2 across the aisle from us. when he did come over and put down cocktail napkins and gave the obligatory "" how are you tonight"", i told him i'd be a lot better if i had some cold water with lemon. he didn't like that and the service was slow for the rest of the night. he did have a very good knowledge of the menu and he was able to answer questions that were asked. that was all very good. my sister inlaw order the grilled assortment . she ordered fingerling potatoes as one of the sides. when the meals were finally served sergey delivered 3 of the 4 meals and said the fingerlings would be "" right out"" and the young woman he said was the manager delivered my meal and i told her we were waiting for the fingerlings and she asked if sergey was taking care of it and i shrugged. some 10 minutes later, the next time i could stop him to ask where they were, he went over and brought them. they were ice cold by that time and my sister in law was half done with her meal. she didn't want me to make a fuss, so i didn't. sergey brought out dessert menus and again disappeared and frankly at this point we'd been sitting around for a long time and just wanted to get the check and get out of there. sergey then came out with the dish of tartuffo's and a candle. he didn't have any idea who's b'day it was so he put the dish in the middle of the table and walked away. unfortunately he didn't serve a spoon or a plate or a dish . just a messy dish with the tartuffo's sitting in chocolate. how did he expect that to be eaten.  i still tipped him generously. the more i thought about this i shouldn't have tipped him at all and told the manager about it, but it was a celebration and there wasn't any opportunity to say anything with my family all around."
2018-08-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"always excellent.  tonight, house salad.. fried shrimp.. broccoli.  others enjoyed bang bang cauliflower, oysters, sesame tuna, crab cakes.  you wouldn't think of it, perhaps, but the margaritas here are really good.  very good service."
2018-08-28,TOM14369,4.0,the waiter was excellent. he suggested the haddock imperial. very good. as was all the meal.
2018-08-28,KarenM,4.0,our meals were *exceptionally* good! we eat there a few times a year and this was truly outstanding! bravo to the chef!
2018-08-27,Cunningham,4.0,"our server was very accommodating and attentive. unfortunately on a monday, the restaurant was out of ne crabmeat and initially 2 lb lobsters. however, they were delivered shortly after ordering a smaller one.  everone’s meal was delicious, particularly the dan dan cauliflower."
2018-08-26,steved,5.0,kudos to mariah our server!  she was tremendous and went way beyond what our expectations were.  very genuine person!
2018-08-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we were in from texas sending our daughter off to her internship. the crab cakes are incredible. no one makes them like legal seafood. we had great service from our waiter carlos and the other team members. they were all so attentive and friendly. no trip to boston is complete without a visit to legal seafood! well worth the trip.
2018-08-22,herb,3.0,we eat at legals a lot.  this time service was slow.  food preparation was slow.  waiter messed up a special water order although it was fixed eventually.  same with request for splitting checks he didn't and then fixed it. food was good.
2018-08-21,KenCH,2.0,service was terrible. we had to wait 30 minutes and ask 3 persons for our bread roll. our food arrived 40 minutes later with completely wrong order. finally we had to call manager (who was very polite and efficient) to straighten out our food order. when i was signing the bill the waitress started cleaning the table throwing bread crumbs and small debris on our clothes.
2018-08-18,Foodiefamily,3.0,"just never been happy with the food at ls, lacking in presentation , menu description did not match what arrived to the table, the haddock special was on a lobster sauce and it was so sparse it hardly made a difference to the dish, and the over serving of rice as an accompaniment is really an insult to the plate! second time in two months and probably my last! took forever for our wine to be served and felt the wait staff are run off their feet, they try hard! i really dint get the hype about these restaurants!"
2018-08-18,Marsha,4.0,"i ordered fish & chips, expecting beer battered fish like the legal's in dedham.  however they were bread crumbed.  i didn't enjoy it as much.  also, if i remember correctly, there was no complimentary wifi."
2018-08-17,SuzanneS,5.0,"i enjoyed the meal but was annoyed that we ordered champagne and the server said ""don't you want a bottle?""
i also did not like that the server brought the bill and stood over me and waited while i gathered the money. geez louise,  give me a minute!"
2018-08-16,F00die,5.0,"everything was excellent except legal was told
this was an anniversary dinner. they should not ask if they
do not do something special."
2018-08-15,TripAdvisor,5.0,"always excellent.  we enjoyed salads, cherrystones, bang bang cauliflower, tuna sashimi, shrimp cocktail, grilled shrimp, halibut.  excellent service."
2018-08-13,out2dine,5.0,"we ordered the lobster clam bake which was delicious. it includes clam chowder, broiled 1.25 lobster, lots of steamers, corn and coke slaw. the blueberry tart was a delicious featured dessert topped with ice cream, enough to share. service was very good and the pace of the meal was just right."
2018-08-13,YSKim,5.0,"our server adilson was courteous, efficient and professional.  our meals were prepared to our liking and delivered to us timely.  no wonder that legal sea foods - framingham is my favorite restaurant!"
2018-08-11,Fran,1.0,this was about the 3rd time i ordered salmon medium rare ( as suggested) and it can dry and over cooked
2018-08-10,Ballou,5.0,legal seafood in framingham massachusetts is always a special event for us. the food is always excellent as well as the service. my wife and i both enjoy the luncheon salmon with two optional sites. this is a great meal and a very good price. i highly recommend the booth along the wall for best seating.
2018-08-10,bosdiner,4.0,"crabcakes and fish tacos were tasty and good sized portions. server was cordial and checked in just the right amount of times. busy place on friday lunch, so you may want to make a reservation. can be noisy if there are large groups near your table."
2018-08-08,JimF,2.0,"traveled to framingham from indiana for a meeting. took wife to dinner as she loves seafood and wanted her to experience fresh, quality, seafood. excellent server, however, the food was average at best. wife ordered the seafood casserole and it was overcooked and extremely dry. to the credit of the server, she immediately offered to replace my wife's meal with a different menu item without any hassle. that customer service approach was outstanding. unfortunately the different dish was again average in taste. no bad, but nothing special. my dishes were also not bad, but were average in taste. again, the service was wonderful and the decor, cleanliness, etc. were good, but the food did not meet our expectations."
2018-08-07,Klink,4.0,"the nutty salmon dish is a favorite of mine, and this night's version was an excellent example. others had sashimi and bluefish, and all of us were satisfied. our waitress was delightful (named elissa, i'm not sure)."
2018-08-06,jsand,5.0,"the summer monday special clam chowder lobster/steamers/corn/cole slaw for $29.95 was a steal and delicious!  the lobster was sweet and succulent.  one of us had the swordfish and highly approved.
a very reasonable meal- all fresh and well-prepared."
2018-08-05,Jonsax,4.0,our go-to place for a good dinner. scallops salad special tonight was especially good.
2018-08-03,Steve,5.0,as usual the oysters were outrageously delicious and the scallops special wonderful. arctic char (photo) always a good choice. only con - noise level can be annoying for conversation.
2018-08-02,ToyW,4.0,great food and service ! fresh and tasty ! a little on pricey side.  would recommend
2018-08-02,reneh,5.0,fabulous meal and service
2018-08-02,MenaL,1.0,"overcooked shrimps, very hot, inside, noisy cuumed cleaning while  we were eating, next to us. poor service"
2018-08-01,Friendtofriend,5.0,always a winner...
2018-08-01,Bill,4.0,"good food, good service  good food, good service  good food, good service  good food, good service  good food, good service  good food, good service  good food, good service  good food, good service"
2018-07-31,DennisA,3.0,rushed to order.  our orders for nutty salmon was dry and not moist.
2018-07-31,CathyB,5.0,"the portions were huge; the fish ultra-fresh.  we loved the sauteed spinach, which they will readily substitute as a side dish. i visited with my elderly mom, who is in a wheelchair, and the staff bent over backwards to hold doors for us, get us situated and make us very comfortable."
2018-07-28,AlanP,3.0,"two of our meals were good and two were not to the level that was expected. the meals took close to twenty minutes to be served. quantity was low, would like to see greater quality on plate. thanks."
2018-07-28,EvaK,5.0,"my husband and i met some friends for dinner and drinks.  the food was exceptional.  my husband had the salmon special which was cooked as he requested medium rare.  our friends both had one of the specials and one requested  a change to the dish (because of an allergy) and was very happy.  we all enjoyed our meals from the beer (a crafted ipa) , our appetizers  calamari and raw cherry stone clams and our main courses.  we will definitely come back."
2018-07-28,Keith,3.0,"food and service at the table was great, i would definitely recommend going here. the front of house staff didn't seem to be trained too well. the girl working the front wasn't very friendly, but the guy was friendlier. we made reservations for the high tops at 8pm. we checked in using our reservation and they told us it would be a few minutes, because a lot of the high top tables were being cleared. we took a peak in and there were lots of open high top tables. we waited for almost 20 minutes while at least 5 parties all came in without reservations, checked in, in some cases did not wait, and in some waited a few minutes, and all got seated to normal seating ahead of us. after almost 20 minutes they called us to be seated, but took us to the normal seats [not high tops as we reserved] and did not say a word about the wait or that we were getting a normal table even after everyone else had been seated before us without reservations. at that point we just wanted to sit and eat, so it wasn't worth mentioning or waiting even longer than we already had. it was a very weird experience, like they thought we wouldn't notice the wait and that we waited for a table we didn't want, sitting next to everyone else who had already been seated ahead of us with no reservation; if it were not for the good food and good waitress we had, i would not recommend going back. even a simple explanation would have been fine, but ignoring us after that long of a wait is unacceptable. 
to top is off the next day i got an email from opentable saying i didn't show up to my reservation [after 3 or 4 you can't make reservations anymore using opentable], so the front desk people never even checked us in. maybe that was tied to the long wait and forgetting we reserved a high top table. .."
2018-07-26,BobM,3.0,for the first time in many visits we were disappointed.  one member of our party was served a dish that belonged to another table.  he received incorrect sides and the fish which he requested to be well done was cooked to a medium level.  another member's fries were cold and not crisp.  the server and management compensated by offering complimentary desserts but we should not have reached this situation.
2018-07-25,TripAdvisor,5.0,"shrimp cocktail, clam chowder, cherrystone clams, blackened halibut, fried shrimp... sonoma cutrer chardonnay... excellent service.  another great meal here."
2018-07-22,Bruce,4.0,had a very good dinner with attentive service. my only criticism is that my wife left her umbrella at our table and called soon after leaving the restaurant to see if the umbrella was found. later we received a call telling us that it was found and would be left at the reception. when my wife stopped by the next day there was no umbrella.
2018-07-22,Rulade,4.0,dinner was delicious & my husband loved his birthday lobster. service was very slow due to a kitchen error. the manager came to our table & explained the problem. we had a nice evening.
2018-07-22,DannyC,3.0,getting more cluttered and noisy with each visit. too much clutter on table - too much inter table traffic/noise - hard to relax and enjoy the excellent meal
2018-07-18,reneh,4.0,great food
2018-07-16,Tbone,5.0,"i love to take advantage of the ""specials"" legals runs. so when i saw the ""c-food mondays"" featuring steamed lobster, steamers, corn, clam chowder, and cole slaw for $29.95, i jumped at it!!  i brought my daughter. we had a lovely dinner.  the lobsters were a little oversteamed and my corn had a bunch of brown spots and we didn't get any coleslaw, not sure why, but our waitress alyssa, was very pleasant and attentive, which can sometimes be an issue at this legals, because it's always so busy!  this was my second week in a row for lobsters at legals. i'll probably be back again for more before the summer is through..."
2018-07-15,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal at legal.  no surprise.  starters of gazpacho, chowder, salad, bang bang cauliflower... my blackened halibut... all great.  margaritas and chardonnay.  excellent service.  love it here."
2018-07-13,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"we went for drinks and appetizers. the tonic was flat in the gin& tonic, and the bang bang cauliflower appetizer had nut oil in the sauce. 
the bigger problem with the appetizer having but oil in it was startled by because we had ordered it but no one ever mentioned the nut oil in the sauce before."
2018-07-12,NancyG,5.0,"food was very good, as usual.  service was great, as well."
2018-07-11,BrianD,5.0,"usually we use legal when we’re at the airport off to europe for a gluten free snack, usually a lobster roll. always excellent there. since we were at a conference we decided that legal in framingham would provide an excellent gluten free meal for the wife. superb dinner with a super amount of excellent food. the proof is in the pudding, and my wife had no problems after dining there. unfortunately this is not always the case at places claiming to be gluten free.

our waiter was a true professional who provided for every need, and even could chat a bit with us. 

we were impressed at how well trained your staff was in that each one encountered managed to say something nice.

bravissimo! gratias vobis agimus!"
2018-07-10,TMoney,3.0,very young people at just stand were unprofessional and rude. manager and server were fantastic. food was very good.
2018-07-10,HSquare,4.0,"service was appropriately attentive. clam chowder was excellent, as usual. seafood casserole had almost no seafood in it: two scallops and a small (1"" square) piece of white fish. rest was sauce and a lot of crumbs on top. steamed lobster looked like it was from the bottom of the barrel. always thought we could get a decent (yet more expensive) meal from legal seafood. guess those times are past."
2018-07-10,YSKim,5.0,"our server eugenio was attentive, friendly and accommodating.  our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to us timely.  thanks, eugenio for making our dining experience fun and memorable.  y.s. kim"
2018-07-08,fern,5.0,we have never been disappointed in a meal at any legal.
2018-07-08,YSKim,5.0,"our server sarah was friendly, accommodating and professional.  our meals were prepared to our order and delivered to us in a timely manner."
2018-07-08,BostonDiner,3.0,"order was not correct, but easily rectified. i ordered chocolate mousse for dessert. the wait was so long (for a pre-prepared dessert!) that i canceled and left after paying the bill. if the mousse was 86– that’s one thing too bad. this experience spoke to a disorganized kitchen. 
i’m gonna leave framingham legal’s off my go to list."
2018-07-07,BGBoston,4.0,they just revamped their menu but much remained the same. the service was great and the grilled halibut was perfection.  the others had crab cake combo and all were as good as usual with delicious scallops and shrimp.  the thai calamari was not as good as usual this visit.  maybe the change in presentation ( no more bamboo box) had a little to do with it but it was lacking in peanuts and the pineapple chunks were tiny and hard.  also there were at least 3 full bodies not cut into  rings (which were very tender but odd)
2018-07-07,ElizabethW,5.0,excellent service and delicious food.
2018-07-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"food was great, staff was very friendly.  we had a great time."
2018-07-06,Davieo,5.0,our order got screwed up .......food was wrong and had to ask for my ordered soup.....unusual for legal
2018-07-06,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"usually very good. took 25m for raw oyster appetizer. meal messed up multiple places. one person
didn’t get their sauce or coleslaw. i didn’t get coleslaw. fries were way under cooked like not even slightly brown. very soft and mushy. seafood (fried) was way over cooked i.e. hard crunchy and slightly burned taste. lots of clams, maybe 6 calamari - and they literally were 1/2
to 3/4” in diameter. almost seemed like scraps. scallops - being over cooked were not very moist. usually this stuff is like butter. very disappointing. 

interestingly one of my party had gluten free and their fries looked identical to mine and their clams were also over cooked the same as mine. given they had to have been done in separate fryers, how would that be possible - unless one of us had their good made i. the same batch / same fryer as the other. scary!"
2018-07-06,Jacqueline,5.0,"we shared soup and an entree and the waiter split them for us. the clam chowder, the cod, and the warm chocolate pudding cake were excellent. my friend enjoyed the crab cake entree."
2018-07-04,TOM14369,4.0,i got the halibut steak. very good. the seafood is always fresh and prepared well
2018-07-04,DRSMALLWOOD,4.0,they changed the salmon and it sucks.
2018-07-02,Mumsedso,5.0,food was delicious and freshly prepared.  our server was outstanding and very helpful.  one in our party has a food allergy and her dishes were handled with care and delivered directly from the kitchen to her by the manager
2018-07-02,Jean,5.0,it was a pleasure dining for lunch.  the service was excellent and the food was very good.
2018-07-01,JacobR,1.0,"this is usually a consistent restaurant with good entree options. i'm not sure if they're training new cooks or it was an off night, but our party of 6 had three dishes that were inedible. was one of our worst seafood dinners anywhere. i couldn't take more than two bites of a $21 fish and chip... was extremely overcooked (chewy/dry) with strong flavor... reminded me a of a fermented fish chip i had in korea. we had to go out for ice cream after just to get the taste out of our mouth. we will not be returning to this location."
2018-06-30,WileyM,3.0,did not have fried oysters. too many french fries with fish and chips. no lime in wine spritzer.
2018-06-29,CaptnDave,5.0,"very nice table for six, quiet out of the traffic xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
2018-06-29,cpearl,2.0,"i don't know if i can give you 50 characters.  the service was awful.  waiter finally took orders and disappeared.  food finally came out and some dishes had to be returned due to not being cooked properly.  bills were wrong as we ordered lunch menu and all bills had to e done again because we were charged for dinner, not lunch."
2018-06-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"area best of class.  when you want an enjoyable meal, come here.  tonight, the house salad... then grilled shrimp.  ran out of baked potatoes, but they cave us some other potatoes that were excellent... as well as brocolli... very good.  others had lobsters that were superb."
2018-06-28,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was welcoming, efficient and effective.  our meals were prepared to our order and delivered to us timely.  legal sea foods in framingham is still my favorite restaurant.  happy independence day!  y.s. kim"
2018-06-27,WendyD,5.0,"love coming to legal.  as a celiac, it is nice to have a meal that i can eat and not worry about getting sick.   thank you for always doing a great job.   looking forward to my next visit."
2018-06-27,KevinD93,4.0,"as usual, i had a great lunch at legal seafoods. i love the quality of the food, ambiance, and service."
2018-06-25,DanF,5.0,"4people, we had haddock, halibut, cod & clams. all were delicious and elegantly prepared. our waitress pam was exceptional."
2018-06-24,John,4.0,"the management has changed the style of menu since our last visit.  the menus used to be the type that opened as a book and there were more options on it.  the new style is a single page, covered in plastic, and has food on the front and drinks on the back.  this may actually be easier to keep clean but some items that were previously offered have been deleted.  one of my favorite items has been the seaweed salad and it was not on the new style menu.  but i asked for it and it was available, so i really don't have an issue with this.
the food and service are always good."
2018-06-23,EstelleD,3.0,"i like the atmosphere at the legal sea foods in framingham, but the food quality is left to be desired. we had only been there twice, but the experience from the second visit doesn't make us want to return, at least not often. the service is ok, depending on which waiter you get. during the first visit, i had the steamed lobster (can't go wrong there with the taste/seasoning, since it's just steamed and dipped in drawn butter). it was slightly overcooked and chewy, but still enjoyable. my husband had the baked lobster, which had way too much breading. during our 2nd visit, the food was well below our expectations. we ordered the buffalo popcorn shrimp as an appetizer, which was fairly salty, and the taste of avocado and blue cheese was lost to the hot sauce they were swimming in. the cioppino had a decent tasting broth, but the bread was hard as rock and unedible. the seafood casserole was salty and over-done (hard, chewy shrimps). we thought we'd end the night with something more on the sweet side and ordered the strawberry shortcake that was in the specials. worse strawberry shortcake we've ever had in our lives!! the biscuit lacked flavor, and the whipped cream was so tasteless that i question if they even added sugar. i'm not big on very sweet desserts at all, but the lack of sugar and flavor in this dessert was so disappointing. we can buy strawberry shortcakes at stop & shop that'll taste better than this."
2018-06-23,Rick,2.0,an otherwise good dining experience was somewhat spoiled by the inattention of our waiter who kept us waiting far too long to bring our bill. we eventually had to ask another waiter to get our bill. the original waiter didn't acknowledge this when he came over as we were getting up from our table.
2018-06-22,TripAdvisor,5.0,"best area restaurant... tonight i had a special app:  scallop casserole... my fried shrimp entree was excellent.  sonoma cutrer vino, excellent service."
2018-06-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,seated right away. helpful and friendly staff. great place for seafood.
2018-06-21,kris,5.0,incredible food and service was top notch. absolutely worth the price. if you haven't try it!
2018-06-21,Steve,5.0,"great time with business colleagues. started with a dozen cohuits on the half shell and some draft craft maine beer. a nice treat after a long day at work. place was packed, with lines of people waiting for a table. the good news: our booth was waiting for us for our open table 7:00 pm reservation. no ""your table will be available soon"" as one usually gets in such popular restaurants. thank you open table and legals!"
2018-06-20,DonS,5.0,our dinner was wonderful!  calamari was light and not too greasy at all.  scallops perfectly done. lobster a tiny bit overdone..a bit chewy...but very good.  char delicious.  we had a great time.  only negative was that it was so noisy we couldn’t hear each other some of the time.
2018-06-19,Rarphantom,3.0,"there for lunch and typical legal. good for business lunches but boring and food is generally bland and uninspiring.  had a tuna burger that was tasteless. service was very good and overall fine, but just needs some tweaking to be more current."
2018-06-17,DannyC,4.0,"noisy, orders confused with nearby tables, not a fan new less mix/match side orders"
2018-06-17,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"my wife ordered the stuffed lobster. it had too much breading! they over did it!

i had a fisherman platter. slightly overlooked! didn’t even finish it!

they took fried oysters off the menu! why i don’t know! this location is become a hit or miss! and it wasn’t even crowded at the time we went. i don’t know."
2018-06-17,Sharonka13,5.0,"met a girlfriend there for lunch on father’s day. it was busy, thankfully we had reservations done in advance. the service was very good, friendly, attentive, but not overly so. the food was fantastic. i ordered lobster bisque and shrimp cocktail, my gf ordered cioppino. first came warm, house made buns, then the food arrived. everything was freshly made and delicious. we enjoyed."
2018-06-16,KristenC,5.0,"reservation through open table was easy and perfect. the restaurant was able to accommodate our small request, all without having to ask for it upon arrival. great experience!"
2018-06-16,Kandy,3.0,"not typical service at a legal
seafoods. had to
remind them to
bring our drinks. think our martini was made as a virgin martini. got an order wrong
and my house salad with tomato balsamic dressing was totally bland. i used to waitress at legals and it was nowhere near par."
2018-06-15,KrisR,5.0,dinner was amazing. went for daughter’s birthday and it was a truly a memorable time with family. sergio was outstanding and everything was great.
2018-06-13,GSF133,2.0,"friendly but poor service and slow. waiter brought a cup of soup when we ordered a bowl.
then he brought the two salads and my husband’s entree altogether. my entree was no where in sight...i think he forgot to order it. showed up 10 minutes later."
2018-06-12,srfoodie,5.0,"we arrived at the restaurant at 6:30 on a tuesday night with a reservation so seated right away. the place was busy and noisy. the service was very fast. i enjoyed baked stuffed shrimp and my friend had crab cakes- entrees we've had before , as good as ever.   we took 1/2 of it home as portions are generous. we shared an order of onion string- limp not crispy- wondered if gluten free flour made the difference. i do like the consistency of the food and think their clam chowder is the best ever."
2018-06-11,MeenaM,2.0,"our waiter (carlos) was the highlight ... the food was ok; the calamri was too fried; the sides for the entree (spinach and jasmine rice) were ok.  the entree itself (fish) - we tried the shrimp, swordfish and mahi mahi -- all 3 dishes were great.

the martini/margarita had to be remade!"
2018-06-11,JAWS,3.0,"we were not happy with the noise, table, wait service. chef was not cooperative with a request for a crab cocktail. food was served with rice that we did not want. very disappointing after many years."
2018-06-09,KeithS,5.0,"dined at legal to celebrate my wife’s birthday. we always are happy at legal and this was no exception. the shrimp was excellent, the scallops redefined fresh and melted in your mouth.  the rose wine from france was very good and complimented the seafood well: not the average rose. finishing with the ice cream bon bons and cappuccino made it perfect."
2018-06-09,JoanO,5.0,"we brought my elderly parents here to celebrate my mom's 80th birthday.  it was a really great meal and the service was very good and attentive.  my only complaint is that there is a lot of background noise in this restaurant and it was hard for my parents to have a conversation with us.  i knew as soon as we walked in that this was going to be an issue - there are high ceilings and a big open space.  other than that, it was a perfect evening."
2018-06-08,MeredithC,5.0,"went for my husband’s birthday. service was fast and attentive, food was excellent as always!"
2018-06-08,Legals,4.0,the food was amazing. the waitress was not that competent. she came back numerous times to ask which wine and then brought the wrong one. i’d go back for the clam chowder and shrimp.
2018-06-05,TripAdvisor,5.0,"always great... most reliable area spot.  loved our bang bang cauliflower, shrimp cocktails, crab cake, lobsters and sides."

2018-06-03,KarenD,5.0,great service!  one of my favorites!  waitress noticed my pre-teen wasn’t loving her fish and took care of the issue right away.
2018-06-03,GailK,4.0,great service and food. room we were in was very loud which made dinner conversation for six quite difficult. that was our only complaint.
2018-06-03,TOM14369,4.0,i went fried clams for once. big portion for the money. their cauliflour appetizer is very good
2018-06-02,brunchalot,4.0,"great spot for quality new england seafood.  it's crowded and noisy and you are eating off a paper placemat .. but your seafood and fish is always the best around, fresh and delicious.  we had a bacon-wrapped scallop appetizer special that was truly outstanding - really common dish but the quality of the scallops and the perfect preparation made this special stand out.  special shout out to the bartender for the amazing pomegranate lemon drop martinis!"
2018-06-02,SueO,5.0,"the food was excellent as usual and the service was superb. the waiter was friendly, accommodating, attentive and humorous.

2018-05-31,PeterT,5.0,once i was afraid that legal sea food has expanded too fast the service and food cannot catch up. i was wrong. they are good as usual.
2018-05-30,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was friendly, effective and efficient.  our meals were prepared to our exact order and delivered to us timely.  thank you, judith, for making our dining experience fun and memorable.  y.s. kim"
2018-05-29,TripAdvisor,5.0,"basically, the best restaurant in the general framingham/natick area.   very reliable, consistent.  loved our shrimp cocktails, cauliflower app, oysters... lobsters.   i'm hooked on the margaritas, which i never expected, but they are excellent.  of course the wine list has always been a nice asset here, some great choices and very good restaurant pricing.  very nice service too."
2018-05-28,holisticman,2.0,pretty pedestrian.  my fish was overcooked and not sure it was actually the advertised red drum but did not want it to be awkward.  waiter/kitchen also got my wife's order wrong.  not up to the legal standard for sure.
2018-05-27,Harvey,5.0,"once again, legals delivers.  this has got to be the most consistent chain in the food business.  kudos well deserved."
2018-05-27,AudreyWC,5.0,"host (older gentlemen) who walked us to our table was wonderful, asked us how our day was and was a real pleasure to speak with. from there, we were greeted with several other waitstaff all of which were great. our actual waiter was truly wonderful, he kept our waters filled, made sure our meals were made to order (swapped out certain sides we requested, no butter, heavy seasoning...),and even knew we would decline the bread and desert! our dinners were fresh and hot, and we could not ask for a better experience and meal! great staff, and great food - love this place!"
2018-05-26,3boysmom,3.0,food was good but not great. service mediocre. expect more from legal and staff said it wasn’t that busy.

2018-05-21,PaulC,4.0,"legal is always a safe choice.  we had salads. mine was with crabmeat in a large bowl, but mostly iceberg lettuce. i would order another salad next time with more variety of veggies and greens."
2018-05-20,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"framingham legals is looking tired. menu is fine, very basic and it’s expensive. it’s good but it used to be great."
2018-05-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"went to leagal seafood for our anniversary. the food was wonderful, wine was great, servive was fantastic! we'll definitely be back!"
2018-05-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"comida muy rica, sitio muy chulo! casi toda la carta puede ser sin gluten. fish and chips y calamares rebozados sin gluten!!! estupendo sitio!!

gluten free crispy calamari and fish & chips! amazing taste!"
2018-05-18,IANPOLMC,4.0,"the food and service are always outstanding. one thing this place does really well is to accommodate large influxes of people without missing a beat. they offer a, day after day, consistent high value dinning experience."
2018-05-18,PattyP,4.0,always love lunch at legal seafood. had the caesar salad with grilled shrimp: so fresh and delicious!
2018-05-15,Ballou,5.0,"we have enjoyed many great meals at this location, but today’s late lunch/early dinner was in the top five. our server, chiasson, was exceptional. his attention to details made a ordinary tuesday into saturday night! starting with his menu recommendations. my wife stayed with her favorite lunch salmon accompanied by nicely prepared broccoli with cheese sauce and a piping hot baked potatoe. of course, chiasson made sure we both had fresh hot rolls and plenty of drink refills. based upon his suggestion, i enjoyed a very special luncheon salad which included grilled scallops, fresh sliced avocado, “boston lettuce “, a delicious dressing, grilled beans, and grilled greek cheese. the combination was delicious and light. to end the meal, we each had a couple of ice cream bon-bons. looking for a great place for fresh, well prepared food, seek out legal in framingham across from the natick mall. be sure to ask for chiasson. make sure he brings the hot knives for the bon-bons!"
2018-05-15,DomenickD,5.0,"we just love this place. bread through to dessert. it is our go to place for many occasions, especially father’s day and dad’s birthdays. great service and awesome clean seafood !
bon appetit !"
2018-05-14,Nsur,5.0,"we had raw oysters appetizer then soft shell crabs.  both were very good but very small.  the ambience is normally very pleasant, but that evening a male person at a nearby table was obviously not in a good mood & let those around him know it-- not enough to be disruptive, but an annoyance for me."
2018-05-13,TOM14369,3.0,went for mother’s day. the good was very good. hard to blame the slower service.
2018-05-13,OpenTable Diner,5.0,mother’s day
2018-05-13,KathleenS,3.0,service was very good . very crowded and noisy cause it was mother’s day. my shrimp cocktail tasted off but my salmon was great and my son loved his sashimi and swordfish steak. dessert was bananas foster and it was ok. good place for special occasions or healthy dinner out with the girls .
2018-05-13,bararn,5.0,"eating at legal is never disappointing. the service is always 1st class. the food outstanding. the noise level is low  enough to be able to talk without yelling. legal is always at the top of my list as to ""where do we want to eat out tonight.?"" drinks & wine are perfect.
reservations are always honored. can't say enough good things."
2018-05-13,WarrenP,5.0,wonderful...as always!
2018-05-13,LindaC,5.0,we were early for our reservation and were very pleased that they seated us immediately.  the service was excellent and the server very personable.  the gods was great as usual.  it was busy but it was mother’s day so that is expected.
2018-05-13,LapY,5.0,"we go there for special occasions, in this case it was mother's day.  their service is impeccable and wait staff is always very knowledgeable on the menu and specials.  our table was around the bar which was not great, much prefer the main dinning room but it was a last minute reservation so we can't be too choosy.  if you do go there, best to make reservations as wait times can be long if you don't have one.  great for a special occasion but a bit pricey to go there on a regular basis."
2018-05-13,HungryCyber,5.0,"they made my meal right!  i made note of something to the manager and she made it right!  i had a great experience and would definitely go back!  a+ customer service and quality food.

2018-05-13,StephenR,5.0,"table for five, service was friendly and prompt, and the food, as always, was outstanding. we'll be back."
2018-05-12,TripAdvisor,5.0,"our go to spot in the area.  awesome seafood... find your favorites.  tonight, shrimp cocktail, the cajun halibut, a couple of margaritas.  great, attentive service.  love it here."
2018-05-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,mother’s day!! super accommodating to our party with food allergies and a newborn in a car seat. great atmosphere and delicious dinner!
2018-05-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great birthday dinner for our friend’s son. the menu gave lots of choices fir our taste. there were lots of grilled and fried options depending on your taste.  our waiter helped us select what we wanted to eat by explaining items in the menu. he checked that we liked the meal we had ordered, and he kept making sure our drinks were refilled. not only was he a sweetheart, but he provided excellent service."
2018-05-05,SusanWeston,3.0,"i recommend legal seafood because there is no other choice.  also, the noise level is extraordinarily loud."
2018-05-05,Potsy999,5.0,"chris, our server, did an outstanding job, which contributed to our enjoyment!"
2018-05-04,GJAWaltham,4.0,"while the dish i got was delicious and very well prepared, something was wrong with it, causing me to become ill later in the evening.  perhaps it was an ingredient i was unaware of and mildly allergic too (i should have asked...).  the service was great and legal is usually a good option, just not this time..."
2018-05-02,PatriciaC,5.0,best seafood ever at legal seafood framingham only.
2018-04-30,JackK,2.0,"legal seafoods in framingham is usually a very good restaurant.  however, over the last two months i have noticed a definite decline in the quality of the meals during busy times.  if you can imagine, i actually sent back a baked potato for being way overdone.  the one that came back was worse.  my wife specified, as she always does, that her salmon be ""cooked through.""  it came nearly raw.  the second piece had a sauce on it not asked for when she ordered.  the third piece, really a recooked first or second, was way over cooked and dry.  i have had several meals where the charge was taken off the bill.  i explained to the manager that i am not here for a cheap meal, just a good one.  this place needs more training of its line cooks."
2018-04-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"amazing food & incredible, professional service, as is always the case with legal. this was our first time at the framingham location, and we can’t wait to go back!"
2018-04-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent food and service. a little pricey.
2018-04-28,JustinS,3.0,food solid but boring. decor needs to be refreshed
2018-04-28,SarahS,5.0,"took my son and extended family there for his 21st birthday. our server was exceptional, very knowledgeable about the menu (including every ingredient in every dish we asked about). they accommodated one member of our party who had to leave early, taking her order and serving her ahead of the rest of us, without hesitation.
ls is not a cheap place, but the food is worth it. on my family budget, it is a 'special occasion' kind of place, but i would not hesitate to go back (once the cc bill is paid off!)"
2018-04-27,TripAdvisor,5.0,another excellent meal.  my crab cake app (plated with a small salad)... and the blackened halibut... both superb.  enjoyed a margarita and a glass of wine.  service was great.  love it here.
2018-04-25,DavidG,5.0,"my boyfriend and i stopped in for a late dinner, seeing as we work odd hours. we were immediately greeted with a smiling face and a warm greeting by the host. we requested to be sat in the bar area, and our server emilie d. came right over to us and greeted us promptly. she recommended dishes to us that we loved and even recommended a dessert for us that we took home. we will most certainly be requesting her for our future visits to this location! thank you emilie!!

sincerely,
dave and arlene :)"
2018-04-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,good but not an amazing experience
2018-04-23,docjeff,2.0,"the fried clams, usually excellent, were very small with too much breading."
2018-04-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we always love eating at legal seafoods!
the manager, kevin, is so friendly and always
makes us feel welcome!"
2018-04-22,foodie245,5.0,"the service was exceptional.  from the hostesses at the front door to our waiter and servers, they provided friendly, prompt and very diligent service and attention.  it was a very pleasant lunch!"
2018-04-22,DonnaA,4.0,"the food was excellent, but based on all the options within a 2-mile radius, the prices were high.  i suspect our waiter has not been on the job for a very long time.  the simple task of filling each water glass  seemed to confuse him, and he needed clarification on what was ordered more than 4 times.  two of us ordered the exact same meal.  one came with white rice and one came with brown rice (as was on the menu) for no apparent reason.   lunch for 6  without any alcoholic drinks or lobster, came to $170.  lunch.

since posting this review, the dm called me and asked a lot of questions about our experience.  he was genuinely concerned."
2018-04-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,this place is always a first class experience
2018-04-21,RobertaC,5.0,great lobster.  weak drinks.
2018-04-20,TexasAMFan,4.0,another great dining experience at legal seafoods. this night was just a spur of the moment decision and it was so good. this location is great and the staff is friendly and accommodating. we dine here several times a year and it is always excellent.
2018-04-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"my wife loves this restaurant! i highly recommend getting a reservation. if you try to walk in, you will be waiting a fair amount of time."
2018-04-17,Boybuilder,3.0,it was late...waiter more interested in going home than serving a meal at 9:30 pm...i guess he would be more attentive at dinner time..
2018-04-16,Boston6,5.0,carlos is always the best - and is one of the reasons we come to legals framingham.
2018-04-15,EdwardJ,4.0,"we had another fine meal at legal seafood for a family birthday celebration. my only difficulty with this restaurant is, at times, some slow service. i like to come in, be seated, and order drinks to enjoy before eating anything. sometimes i have noticed that this process takes too long -- too long to get a drink order in, and then too long to get the drink brought to us.
the slow service can also extend to the food delivery, but most times, it is well worth the wait because the food is generally very good/excellent. i had the lobster bake and it was just awesome. so if you love seafood, and don't mind some slowness on the service front, then i definitely recommend this restaurant."
2018-04-15,Davieo,4.0,very good seafood
2018-04-15,Ellen,1.0,"i have been to legal seafoods in framingham many times. sadly, this last time was a major disappointment. the host was very accommodating and seated us at a round table for 6. our waiter was a pleasant young man who took our orders immediately. then the experience went downhill. he took no notes of our orders and we figured he must have great recall. we were wrong as much of the order was wrong. the service was frenetic -- felt more like a diner than a relatively expensive restaurant. waitstaff was poorly trained reaching across diners to deliver food; diners having to point to the dish they ordered. worst of all the seafood we order was poorly cooked (grilled scallops were barely browned and very soggy; fish and chips overly breaded). this has been my ""go-to"" restaurant for family gatherings. we will have to find another location."
2018-04-14,andy,5.0,"food was great very consistent, server was one of the best i ever had was on top of everything."
2018-04-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great time! good food!
2018-04-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had lunch after my son’s confirmation ceremony.  our waiter was very nice and professional.  we always enjoy coming back to legal seafoods!
2018-04-13,TripAdvisor,5.0,"loved my cajun halibut tonight... moist, perfectly cooked.  shrimp cocktail, so good, to start.  sonoma cutrer chardonnay rounded out a great meal."
2018-04-13,ElizabethV,5.0,food was delicious and our waiter was great.
2018-04-13,Maggieellis,4.0,food was excellent and also service.  the only negative was the a/c was freezing.  first semi-warm day and it was so cold in the restaurant.  had to ask  couple of times for it to be turned down.
2018-04-10,STEPHENC,4.0,"for some reason the front desk service once again was weak, at best. attempted to seat us in the worst 2 seat option in the entire restaurant, walk in would be fine but with a reservation totally unacceptable. excellent host then gave us a nice booth. exceptional server !! excellent food as always !"
2018-04-08,Beachgirl,3.0,"my dinner was excellent, but i was disappointed that they have taken coconut shrimp off of the menu.  i had specifically chosen legal seafood for my birthday dinner because i love the coconut shrimp.  we also ordered an appetizer that we always order, however they had run out of it."
2018-04-07,Chuck,5.0,very good food. very nice to us. we will be back. the food was cooked just the way it should have been.
2018-04-07,jsands222,5.0,always a great dining experience. food is fresh and well prepared.

2018-04-05,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is a great spot for seafood... especially in this area it stands out.  my house salad and grilled shrimp was excellent tonight.  chardonnay, perfect."
2018-04-05,DavidH,5.0,"service was excellent, my halibut was the best i ever had. server was right there every time my glass was almost empty. four star at 3 star prices. highly recommend."
2018-04-05,Ballou,5.0,judy was spectacular as always. i had the salmon with broccoli and coleslaw. my wife had salmon as well. the service was fantastic!
2018-04-03,PattyP,4.0,wonderful meal! nutty salmon was so delicious. perfectly fresh.
2018-04-03,SadieL,5.0,birthday lunch
2018-04-01,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith was welcoming, courteous, effective and professional.  our food was prepared as we specified and delivered to us efficiently.  manager and a few of the staff came by our table to say hello."
2018-04-01,Eattoomuch,3.0,"very busy on easter... service was fair. clam chowder very good as usual, but seafood casserole too salty. 1.5lb lobster good."
2018-04-01,NMAC,2.0,the clams in the clam chowder were very chewy and the jasmine special shrimp lacked flavor and was dried out. it used to be so good and now it's not.
2018-04-01,Ginzo,3.0,"the food is good but not great. the presentation of the food on the plate is my main complaint, especially when the price is factored in.  the main entree fish is piled over the side dish like the rice. to much rice on the plate."
2018-04-01,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we went for easter brunch.  after being forgotten by servers when we were first seated everyone went above and beyond to apologize for the mistake. as always he food is great.
2018-03-31,Frabad,3.0,"we invited our adult grandaughter to join us for a birthday dinner. unfortunately, we must have hit an off night for the kitchen and serving staff. we all ordered the cioppino which we've enjoyed many time in the past.
we received our requested ""lobster bibs"",  but we had to find a server to provide us with soup spoons and shell fish forks. when the dishes were served, we saw the lobster claws were not cracked. we eventually  found a hostess seating a group near us and requested lobster crackers. two were delivered and we requested a third for the other diner in our party. 
the food and wine were up to the standards we have come to know at legal seafoods."
2018-03-31,SHEILAM,5.0,food was delicious and prepared exactly how it was ordered with special requests. ally our server in the bar was wonderful.
2018-03-31,Hopkinslax,5.0,"always good food and great service.
we have been going for 10 years and have never had a bad experience"
2018-03-29,TripAdvisor,5.0,"awesome chow again tonight.  grilled shrimp with snap peas and a house salad... sesame tuna, cherrystones... all excellent.  sonoma cutrer, our usual rounded out an excellent meal."
2018-03-29,Kimberly,5.0,"we had a fabulous date night out. our server tom (with the awesome mustache) was excellent. he was professional, attentive and enthusiastic. his personality and confidence in recommendations made the evening really enjoyable. we felt well catered to and had a lot of fun. bang bang cauliflower always a winning starter!"
2018-03-28,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"good not great food.  expensive.  large noisy dining areas.  too ""corporate "" for my taste and best if you're on an expense account.  much better local alternatives are captn marden and the dolphin."
2018-03-27,snowbird,4.0,"always reliable,good food.you can always rely on legal to present a good lunch or dinner."
2018-03-26,Dave,3.0,the lite clam chowder is excellent. the trout was prepared well.  good value. we sat at a booth and felt comfortable with sufficient privacy during our conversation.  the service was mediocre. we waited an hour for the main course.
2018-03-26,KenP,4.0,great food and service.
2018-03-25,KathyM,1.0,"we sat at the bar for the 2nd time in a month and ordered a glass of cabernet.  the bartender
informed me that they were having a distribution problem and that we would have to purchase
a bottle if we wanted cabernet.  i informed the bartender that we had the same response weeks before.  the manager then came over and apologized and stated that this would never happen again so we informed him  that he  had  the same response the last time.  one time would be bad enough but for this to happen for a second time in a months time...inexcusable!!  the attitude was "" we don't have a cabernet that we want to sell by the glass so tough!""  we are consistent patrons of the dedham c bar.... this has certainly put a bad taste in our mouth in respect to the legal seafood brand."
2018-03-25,MarceloC,5.0,"love legal....  we travel over an hour just to have dinner there!!!  fresh, delicious, very accommodating with allergies/dietary restrictions."
2018-03-25,PattyP,4.0,"great meal, great service!"
2018-03-24,HC70,5.0,"legal in framingham is one of my most favorite restaurants  -  terrific seafood, great service and a relaxed atmosphere!  my wife and i ate there this past saturday night and, while the food is always good and fresh, our dinner on saturday was memorable.  the muscles were outstanding, the crab cakes & scallops to die for  -  can't wait to go back!!!"
2018-03-24,Bruce,4.0,"the server was friendly and helpful. somehow, though, i was brought a salad which somebody else had ordered. after i ate the salad,  i learned that my salad actually came with my dish and was not the salad i was served and that i was going to be charged for the extra salad. when i expressed my disappointment that i was going to be charged because of an error by the server, she said i would have to speak with the manager. no one came to speak with me and i  was not charged for the salad.  so all was well. 
it might be helpful to let new servers know that they are empowered to correct mistakes without having the manager come to handle it. i suspect that this is what she was told when she asked."
2018-03-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"not the most inviting environment with a young child, placed in the far back room with other families."
2018-03-23,MarciaH,4.0,beer pours getting smaller and smaller. the prices are higher than most seafood restaurants . used to go more often but have cut back due to prices.
2018-03-23,ElizabethW,5.0,the clams were absolutely delicious and our waiter couldn’t have been better. it was a wonderful meal.
2018-03-22,TripAdvisor,5.0,"doesn't get much better for an every day place for seafood.  loved our chowder, grilled mahi... started with shrimp cocktail.  sweet."
2018-03-20,JaniceG,5.0,loved our server chase.  this is one of my favorite places for a special occasion. always enjoy my experience at lsf.

2018-03-17,dinnerwithdad,5.0,"consistently good fish and side dishes, service is always excellent"
2018-03-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food and service were excellent.  my husband has a gluten allergy and they took great care to explain how the chefs  prepare foods for customers with food allergies. they even have a runner to deliver it to the table. the gluten free menu is outstanding! my husband enjoyed onion rings and a fisherman’s platter. well worth the 80 mile trip just to have dinner!
2018-03-17,DavidF,5.0,great server and delivered awesome service!
2018-03-15,CindyS,5.0,we had a great birthday celebration. everyone loved their meal!

2018-03-10,TripAdvisor,5.0,"reliable and consistent chow...  badly needed in the area.   parking easy.   another excellent meal here... shrimp cocktail, house salad, lobster and baked pot.  sonoma cutrer half bottle.  nice!"
2018-03-04,Susan32,3.0,"we have eaten at legal sea foods in framingham many times, often for special occasions, as was this. the food is always excellent and usually the service is too. on this occasion, our waitress was slow and somewhat scatterbrained. she forgot our drink order, and the drinks arrived with the food some 15 or 20 minutes after ordering them, but only after i flagged a manager. they did comp our soups, but more to the point, it would have been better to have our drinks when ordered. the food was also slow to arrive and only with the assistance of several others who were helping out. the restaurant was not particularly crowded so the only excuse for the slow service was our waitress, unfortunately!"
2018-03-04,Cold,5.0,our server cooky was one of the best servers we have ever had anywhere.
2018-03-04,Doug,3.0,"it has  been a long time since i last ate at legal's, from my opinion, the quality of the food was not as good has it used to be."
2018-03-03,LisaA,3.0,"i had hake imperial and when it came, the fish was underdone and smelled like ammonia.  they quickly and efficiently made something else for me.  the fried clams as always were good.    i would have thought that the quality of this fish would have been impeccable since it was their special  this was disappointing.   we had the bourbon pecan tart which was phenomenal!!  they took the desert off the bill for our trouble."
2018-03-02,LynnG,5.0,service was excellent. one issue with food that was immediately remedied and we were extremely pleased with the food and service overall.
2018-03-02,BettyP,5.0,as always legals framingham never disappoints.  one of our favorite spots.
2018-03-02,porlier,5.0,"we arrived 5 minutes late for our 10:00 reservation due to extra long movie previews.  the manager graciously checked the kitchen to see if we could order after closing time.  we were seated and served by william (201990) and had a relaxing and enjoyable meal as we usually do here after a movie.  there was no rush.  the bread rolls were even a little undercooked, so, just right."
2018-02-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,another excellent meal.  couldn't resist having the bay scallops again... so good.  salad to start and some white wine... how can you go wrong?
2018-02-25,OpenTable Diner,2.0,poor service had to keep reminding waiter of things
2018-02-24,MaryG,4.0,"the food was fabulous and the waitstaff were awesome.  steamed lobster, seafood casserole and cioppino were all delicious.  only negative was that the littlenecks were small."

2018-02-21,LisaM,4.0,excellent service - just the right amount of attention. reasonable noise level - could  hear 6 our of the 8 people. wish there was a way to section off larger groups to give the feeling of privacy.
2018-02-20,TripAdvisor,5.0,legal is a classic.  this place stands out for excellent chow in the area.

devin our server was knowledgable, outgoing and super friendly....

had a great experience"
2018-02-17,EllenK,2.0,i got the  haddock imperial which i love at prime bar in wayland.  the potato was so big that it was hard and not edible.  they brought me a new one that was the same. the fish was way too well done.  my wife got salmon and loved it.  maybe i was just unlucky.  let me know what you think. 508-298-3396
2018-02-17,AngelaD,5.0,"wonderful friendly staff!! exquite food and drinks. the prices are mid range but very reasonable and truly you get everything and more for  what you pay!! deserts are amazingly delicious. intimate settings which allow for private conversations, where you don’t feel other customers or staff are listening in on your conversation!!! i made a reservation my table was ready and my mom and i were seated 15 min earlier!!"

2018-02-15,RayT,5.0,"very nice meal and excellent service.  being that it was valentine's day, the restaurant was very crowded.  in spite of this, the service and food delivery was prompt and attentive and the meals were prepared perfectly.  my only small quibble was that knives weren't included as part of the table service.  that made buttering the bread a little challenging."
2018-02-14,LinaG,5.0,"the food is always great. and the service is outstanding. 
the salmon and swordfish dishes were delicious.
i didn’t like the new boston cream pie!
sorry extremely sweet."
2018-02-14,Mike,4.0,my mahi mahi was outstanding.  service was very good.  my only comment is that the sides are not very good.  a small selection that are really not up to speed with their seafood.
2018-02-14,Thomas,3.0,so so. not the value and service we've come to expect from a legal seafood brand.
2018-02-14,DanielleW,5.0,carlos was an awesome waiter. he made the experience at legals fantastic.

2018-02-12,FrankL,2.0,"went to meet an old friend for light lunch and a lot of catching-up.  ordered the caesar salad for my entree. the lettuce was “swimming” in dressing, great taste, but way too much.
table next to us was very loud and we found it difficult to have a conversation."
2018-02-11,John,4.0,"always a good choice. was a little disappointed that they were out of the sole filet that i wanted, but there were plenty of other good choices.  our server was pleasant and helpful.
have been there many times and will go back again."
2018-02-11,OpenTable Diner,4.0,crab cakes were tasty and hearty. scallops were great and waiter explained dry pack which means nothing added to cheat for weight. boston cream pie was interesting with sauce and toffee crunches on top of a round portion- tasty but not  traditional. maple bread pudding was more like coffee cake
2018-02-11,JoJowithappreciation42,5.0,our waiter (arthur) was terrific and the food was delicious.  still a bit too noisy but we had a good evening
2018-02-10,ClaudetteM,5.0,"we have been going to legal for years.  i am a seafood person and my husband usually has the hamburger, which, he says is excellent.  the food is always great, service is impeccable and i highly recommend it."

2018-02-07,foodie4boston,3.0,"this restaurant manager claims that the state law only allows them to serve one drink per hour which is to true. the claim that because, apparently,  they were cited twice because someone was leaving restaurant and driving drunk got caught. we were not driving but they said they can not serve more than one drink per hour.  will not go back."
2018-02-06,TripAdvisor,5.0,"if it isn't fresh, it isn't legal!  love this place.  my lobster tonight, perfect."
2018-02-03,Hudsontravelers,5.0,"legal seafood  of framingham is never a disappointment. we met friends on a busy sat. night. we were seated promptly at a table in a side room which was less noisy. the food was delicious. since we are watching our carb consumption, we were able to make substitutions for potato and pasta. ample portions allowed for another small meal the next day."
2018-02-03,LFul,5.0,"we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner during our most recent visit to legal seafood.  the fish was expertly prepared, the service was first rate & the atmosphere was charming. we highly recommend this wonderful restaurant."

2018-01-22,Mike,4.0,the swordfish and the maui mahi was excellent.  overall a very enjoyable experience.
2018-01-21,TripAdvisor,5.0,i am a regular patron of legal seafood as it's always excellent... this location stands out as it's one of the only places in the area that's of such high quality.  my steamed lobster with baked potato and veggies was great.  service was very good.
2018-01-20,Ehad2,3.0,"legal seafood needs no introduction to their legendary seafood menu. our group opted for the broiled fish menu which unfortunately continues to get shorter over the years. for me, this is what they do best and should expand on that more. 
i ordered artic char which was delicious, a generous portion cook very well. our other diners ordered similar.
the service was great. our only disappointment was desert. we ordered a dark chocolate mousse to share. the parfait glass was half filled with whipped cream, leaving only a small portion of chocolate mousse. unfortunately, the mousse was like runny pudding. really uneatible. although i pointed this out to our server, he did not offer to deduct it from our bill. not a good outcome."
2018-01-20,flowerlady,5.0,"the food was excellent.  the service was as we like it -- attentive without being intrusive.  we dined mid-afternoon, which is a quieter time."
2018-01-18,Ballou,5.0,"tom was our server. he was professional, thorough, and very pleasant. i had the fisherman platter with broccoli and butternut squash. my wife had scallops with mashed and broccoli. we finished it off 3 bon-bons each. great table, friendly staff makes for a nice experience!"
2018-01-16,BillS,5.0,legal is always very good. best chowder ever. very tasty and fresh seafood. bar is great for eating and watching sports.
2018-01-15,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent visit.  loved my clam chowder and jasmine shrimp... a great shrimp dish with broccoli, rice and a cheesy sauce.  tried the halibut as well, perfect.  nice service."
2018-01-15,Cunningham,4.0,"we took advantage of chowda day with chowder $1 a cup with an entree. of course, this was too much food, so i took half of it home.  food and service were excellent."
2018-01-14,Lucia,4.0,legals is a great place to go for outstanding seafood. the clam chowder is the best around.
2018-01-14,lilli,5.0,"my favorite dish is a caesar salad with fresh maine crabmeat, but when supplies are low and i cannot get the crabmeat, i'll choose something else similarly healthy and tasty. this time it was the grilled shrimp and sweet potato with kale. i was outstanding. so delicious. i have never had a bad mean at legal, and we've been going there--framingham, cambridge, boston--for at least 25 years."
2018-01-14,Mike,4.0,"got put in the back room on the right. pretty close quarters.  the table next to us complained about it being too cold so they cranked up the heat to the point that it was unbearable.  oysters, shrimp, scallops always great.  server was ok.  a little slow to come around.  i go there often and will continue to go back but the experience was just a little bit off tonight."
2018-01-14,SandraC,5.0,the food was outstanding.  the waitress was very efficient and friendly.  i would definitely return.
2018-01-14,Mjant45,5.0,as always superior service and the very best very freshest seafood.  always worth the trip!

2018-01-13,OpenTable Diner,3.0,it was good
2018-01-13,1234,2.0,i usually enjoy legal but the other night was off.  the service was fair at best and my tuna steak was over cooked .
2018-01-12,JodyP,4.0,we typically go to this legals for special occasions like mother's day or when all the kids are home and this week we went to celebrate a friend getting her doctorate.  we had a wonderful server and the food was at its consistently very good level.  the only glitch was that for some reason my food order wasn't placed.  the server and manager handled it very well.  i was offered something to eat such as a salad or bowl of chowder gratis so that i would not be watching the other 3 in my party eat.  i chose the delicious fish chowder.  my meal finally arrived when they were almost done: baked stuffed shrimp which was also delicious.  then to our surprise they comped my meal for the error.  that's excellent service.  we had an enjoyable evening out with good friends and delicious food.
2018-01-11,itsalldownhill,5.0,great spot for a business lunch in framingham. highly recommended.
2018-01-08,janer,3.0,the food was average at best. they ran out of two of the three meals we ordered. my broiled fish platter had little flavor and looked baked not broiled. bar had a funky smell. will not be in any rush to go back. our waiter was sweet.
2018-01-07,BillN,5.0,friendly experienced servers. good food.
2018-01-05,TripAdvisor,5.0,"love legal.  when i am looking for a place that i know will deliver... and can have some healthy choices as well, this is such a great spot.  loved my lobster tonight!"

2018-01-02,Katadin,5.0,the service was wonderful. seth was a great waiter.  the oysters were delicious and good and cold.
2018-01-01,WeeklyWanders,3.0,"legal is never my first choice when thinking of going out for a great meal. i find them over-priced for what they do offer but i had gotten a really nice gc from a client as a thank you and decided to take the family. unfortunately they lived right up to expectations. the best thing on the table were those great rolls, after that it went downhill pretty quickly. my nutty salmon was over cooked, as were the two fisherman’s platters at the table. only the large pieces of fish were decently done, the smaller pieces like the clams were rubber bands. the scallop dinner at the table was likely the best of the bunch, though the fish chowder raised the comment “where is the fish”. my daughter is a vegetarian and never wants to eat here because of the limited options, and was disappointed with her salad.  i ordered the special dessert of the day with was a warm maple bread pudding with ice cream. just to “frost the cake” the bread pudding came out hard as a rock and completely frozen, though the ice cream was good. i sent that back and the next one was quite good when it was actually warm."
2018-01-01,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great service fast efficient and friendly. we were disappointed that at 7.30 on new year’s eve they had already sold out of large and medium lobsters!!

i love legal sea food, for lunch as well as dinner."
2017-12-29,RaquelV,3.0,"we used to come here often (as in 1-2 times weekly). haven’t been recently as we have been going to the burlington restaurant more often.  this particular framingham visit was not our best. food was good as usual. we were seated in the lounge and i probably should have requested a table in the main restaurant. sitting right next to a window in a cold snap in new england means keeping you winter jacket in throughout dinner. our server seemed distracted and we could overhear hear his private conversations with other staff. i felt this was unprofessional. i ordered salmon and was brought swordfish. the server came to “apologize” and showed me that he had written down swordfish not salmon. he also told me that he would have asked how i wanted my salmon cooked if i had ordered it. he never said he was sorry for the mistake. he said he was sorry for the “miscommunication.”  i didn’t miscommunicate. i don’t like swordfish. i would not have ordered it. he heard me wrong and wrote it down wrong. the mistake was his and he implied that i had ordered the wrong thing. the manager came by and apologized in a professional manner as would be standard in a restaurant such as this. when they brought our bill the did comp my son’s dessert and my coffee which is also pretty standard in such a case, particularly since i was not rude about the mistake, just asked for the correct order.  finally, i came home to find an email from open table saying that i had no showed on my reservation, and that i would get a black mark on my account for it. (four strikes and your account will be suspended). this shouldn’t matter to me as i always cancel reservations rather than no show and i will not reach the four mark termination point, but when i checked in at the desk at legal and said i had a reservation and gave my name, the staff never checked me in. it was not busy so they just seated us. open table was able to confirm with the restaurant that we dined there (given the above experience). sloppy"

2017-12-27,MaureenF,3.0,unfortunately even though we had a reservation we had to wait 20 to be seated.  the first table was too small for 8 people so we had to move.  we had to wait a long time for our food

2017-12-26,Chapo,5.0,"i've been here a number of times. the last two visits, i had the same server. chiasson is one of the best servers that i've had the pleasure of meeting. he is focused and thoughtful, with a great memory. looking forward to next time. see you soon!"
2017-12-26,HappyCustomer,5.0,i've loved legal seafoods for nearly 50 years. their food only gets better. the menu offers so many options and the food is always reliably delicious and healthy. if you steer clear of the fried options. but those are delicious! this is a reliable go to restaurant and great for almost any occasion.

2017-12-25,RichardS,5.0,the waiter sergio was excellent.  he made the dinner. we went christmas  day and from making dinner suggestions to service 5 star.  i had twin lobster one baked stuffed and was very good  with  shrimp crab and scallops very good. my wife had steak and very pleased.  we have been 6 or 7 times this year and always great food.

2017-12-25,Peetie,5.0,"repeating a xmas eve tradition that has not disappointed in 3 years. 
the service was excellent and we both had cocktails - mine the old favorite maple old fashioned and my wife loved the cranberry lemon drop. she was not entirely satisfied with eth clams and immediately was offered a nice salad, to go with her twin lobsters. my bang bang cauliflower - delicious preceded an excellent piece of swordfish with red onion jam. ourserver emily was delightful and we succumbed to bread and butter pudding topped with caramel, with maple syrup sauce. it is obvious we left the restaurant happy and replete."
2017-12-25,CharlesC,4.0,"all was good. lounge area is noisy and sitting near the window was chilly.
food was good."
2017-12-24,WSPtheWASP,2.0,"our christmas eve dinner out with elderly parents was a disappointment. service was poor. our order was ""lost"" by the waiter which meant our neighboring tables enjoyed a full course meal, paid their bill, left and were replaced by another party before our appetizer, fried clams, arrived. the clams were cold and sparse. my diet coke was flat and syrupy and the requested lemon did not arrive until the ice in the drink had melted. two of the four entrées, baked stuffed shrimp with broccoli, were rubbery and cold. there was supposed to be a crab meat stuffing but i was hard-pressed to find any crab meat in the mass of mushy flavorless bread-like pudding. my mother had only 3 shrimp in her entrée...we counted the tails for each order. the broccoli, the accompaniment, was cold and tough, not al dente, mind you, but, ""sir, may i please have a serrated knife to chop off the tree trunks of the broccoli before i attempt losing my teeth when i take a bite?""
     the coffee was excellent as were the ice cream bonbons and the warm rolls.
      after having been to legal for more than 30 years the quality of both the food and the service was sadly lacking. the manager, after speaking to her privately, had one of the four meals comped as well as the appetizer, which took over 40 minutes to arrive. overall, it felt like just another overpriced, commercial restaurant chain. even keeping in mind that it was a busy holiday weekend and our waiter seemed to be undergoing a personal crisis,  i will not choose to dine at the framingham legal seafood in the near future."
2017-12-24,JenO,3.0,always a good meal.
2017-12-22,Mitch,5.0,"we go to legal seafoods often and it never disappoints. we brought our cousin who came for the first time and she loved it. they split the lemon caper dover sole and it not only fed both of them they had leftovers as well. i had the chef's assortment of salmon, swordfish, tuna scallops and shrimp and it was superb. if you want to go out for seafood legal seafoods is excellent."
2017-12-22,EileenM,4.0,"it starts with the delicious hot rolls and goes on from there. the chowder is the best we have ever had, and that's going back to the 1980s. the shrimp and pasta was just right for a cold winter night and we love the crabcakes. it's a rare visit when we don't order them. so - another winner a dinner at legal's. it's not cheap, but it is consistently excellent."
2017-12-22,Mook,2.0,"unfortunately, the scallops were over breaded and too few in number, but the fish chowder is pretty hard to mess up.
i have been coming here for years, and this was a bad but so far unique screw up.  they provided dessert at no charge in recompense."

2017-12-17,Joseph,3.0,we were seated in a very noisy corner of the restaurant. the temperature went from very warm to blowing cold air from a vent directly on us. just not the best place to sit. i had the trout which was very good my wife had the sole which was very bland. overall the experience was mixed. service was very good but the location was very loud and uncomfortable.

2017-12-16,SuburbanFoodie,4.0,"we've been to this legal sea foods restaurant a number of times for special occasions.

consistently, the service has been excellent with attentive but not overbearing waitstaff.

the quality of the food has been steadily decreasing.  still good but no longer outstanding, particularly the crab cakes which really were noticeably worse."
2017-12-16,AmyH,5.0,"we were tucked in a quiet corner in a back room, which we liked. our waiter responded quickly when we mentioned feeling overly warm and soon felt comfortable. everyone enjoyed their meal—everything was fresh, hot and delicious. two orders of ice-cream bonbons arrived gratis to help us celebrate two birthdays. a great experience."
2017-12-15,Davieo,4.0,as usual the food was outstanding .....very fresh fish and great lite chowder. service was very friwndly and efficient. this location is a bit noisy due to high ceilings i think. we go there at least monthly.
2017-12-15,Starrgarden,3.0,"this has been a restaurant where i expect to get decent fresh properly prepared seafood. the framingham location has dropped the ball again.  i ordered ri style calamari and a caesar salad for lunch with a dear friend.  the calamari were frankly awful, tasted frozen, over cooked and a big pool of oil in the dish.  such an easy dish to do well and they were terrible. salad and service were very good.  i did not complain at the time to avoid upsetting my friend.  shouldn’t have to!  also had a horrid 2/13 dining experience there but forgave that one due to how busy it was that night.  no excuse for the food i was served this time."

2017-12-10,flowerlady,5.0,"as always, we enjoyed our meals.  the food is consistently excellent.  we have never been disappointed.  we appreciated the waitress, who was attentive without being intrusive.  also, it was a relief not to hear ""perfect!"" or ""no problem"" all the time.  either she was exceptional or the wait staff has been asked to refrain from insincere superlatives.  the noise level was moderate because it was mid-afternoon.   it can get noisy there."

2017-12-08,robs,1.0,"four of us for dinner. the waiter mixed up 2 drink orders. one of us got the wrong vegetables with the meal. the scallops were dry. the haddock also dry. also the dozen oysters ordered as appetizers never showed up. 
the manager came by to correct things . still the service got mixed up.  it was noisy as well. 
overpriced for the value."
2017-12-07,ZachJ,3.0,"first off, the service was outstanding. but, overall i was disappointed with the meal. the crab dip appetizer was good, very rich and filling. however, the seafood assortment main dish was a let down.  included were: scallops- best part of the dish! shrimp - very good. swordfish - dry and bland. tuna - dry and bland. salmon- very dry. i do wish my server would have asked if i would like these cuts medium rare to ensure some moisture in the fish, but that’s my fault for not asking how they are cooked. i have had all 3 of these cuts of fish before at other restaurants, and thus i am familiar of the taste and this just didn’t stack up to the other times i’ve eaten these fish."
2017-12-05,RodB,5.0,"attended the framingham site for a business dinner with guests from japan.  they loved their lobster and chowder meal.  the service was excellent!  no rush yet very attentive.  food was excellent, hot and served at the same time so no one was waiting for their meal."
2017-12-03,Bonnie,5.0,"as usual we enjoyed our meal very much. it was a family reunion. we had our fave table and enjoyed a lovely afternoon. our waitress, cookie, was a phenom!"
2017-12-03,OpenTable Diner,5.0,scrumptious food. attentive server. comfortable atmophere
2017-12-03,FRITS,3.0,"waitress was forgetful .
did not bring completed drink.
did notmentiondifferent options available for vegetables.

food was good.
noise level very high.
difficult to have a romantic conversation."
2017-12-02,Raif,4.0,a very nice nearby restaurant. easy to reserve and prompt in seating. large menu with many choices well prepared.  wait staff is really excellent.
2017-12-02,YSKim,5.0,"my friend susanne visiting me from new mexico and i enjoyed our dinner with sergey serving our table.  sergey was welcoming, efficient and professional.  he's indeed one of my favorite servers at the legal sea foods in framingham.  happy holidays to everyone at the legal sea foods in framingham, which is my favorite restaurant!  y.s. kim"
2017-12-02,gigi,5.0,thanks for the gluten free opportunities! yummy especially the garlic shrimp and jasmine rice! can't wait to return😉
2017-11-29,YSKim,5.0,"our server judith l was welcoming, courteous, professional and efficient.  our appetizer shrimp cocktail, soup clam chowder, and our main course lobster rolls were prepared to our liking and delivered to us timely.  our dessert chocolate cake was delicious.  a few staff members including manager lisa came over to our table to welcome us.  my guest and i are very grateful to all of you for making our dining experience memorable.  happy holidays, everyone!  y.s. kim"
2017-11-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"figure i've been to various legal seafoods over 1000 times over the years... because its so consistent and good.  tonight, the perfect shrimp cocktail to start, followed by blackened halibut... another great dinner.  sonoma cutrer chard rounded out the nice evening.  excellent service."
2017-11-27,susie,5.0,great food and great service. there is something for even the fussiest eater on this menu - and it's all done well. the surroundings are very comfortable at  the framingham location.
2017-11-26,Lscapecod,5.0,went for my son's birthday with my 13 month old granddaughter who loves salmon.  waiter was wonderful and accommodating and there is no place like legal seafoods anywhere that has better fish.  always fantastic.  nutty salmon is delectable!
2017-11-26,Irishsw,5.0,food was excellent. we eat seafood so often at home that one of us opted for the filet mignon and it rivaled anything at well known steak restaurants. prices were reasonable. draft beer selection could be a bit more adventurous. our server seemed to be still learning but he was very friendly and the meal was well paced.
2017-11-25,Carol,5.0,"once again, outstanding sea food. butternut squash was great. 
my favorite sea food restaurant."
2017-11-24,Valeria,5.0,"always a great experience , will recommend  to visit"

2017-11-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"third year we have been for thanksgiving diner, no clean up, no cooking and really very good.
after cooking for 37 years we are happy to enjoy your dinner."
2017-11-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"went on thanksgiving; awesome to escape the chaos of cooking at home. 
1. server very helpful, able to accommodate dietary needs of our party (one gluten-free, one vegan) smoothly. 
2. restaurant too loud. 
3. one of our cocktails (a daiquiri) was terrible. (most common comment: “dis they forget the rum?”)"
2017-11-23,Bonnie,5.0,we were lucky to get a corner round booth table in the bar area...both 96 year old mom and 75 year old husband have hearing loss and this was a terrific location for them to hear better. no tables around us...allison was a terrific waitress and we'd request her and the same table when family visits next week. will be calling for reservation soon!
2017-11-23,JayC,5.0,thanksgiving dinner. turkey and all fixins were superb!!

2017-11-23,Chrissy,5.0,"we had a fabulous server who made our thanksgiving meal a wonderful feast.  he made
sure everything was perfect.  two of us have gluten allergies and there was no problem 
with ordering with this restriction...there were even gluten free rolls available.  highly
recommended."
2017-11-23,Mike,4.0,clam chowder always delicious.  i had the special mahi mahi which was delicious.
2017-11-21,CatieF,4.0,"stopped by for a hearty meal enroute to the airport and, as usual, we were not disappointed.  we ordered the seafood casserole, which included a generous portion of lobster meat, scallops and shrimp. side orders of whipped butternut squash with cranberries and roasted brussels sprouts were included.  delicious!"
2017-11-20,JudiB,4.0,my chopped greek salad was great! my friend's $35.00 swordfish was not as good:(
2017-11-20,YSKim,5.0,"daniel who was serving our table was welcoming, courteous, professional and efficient.  the food was tasty and prepared to our liking.  general manager ming provided us a complimentary dessert of 4 bon bons.  my heartfelt thanks go to the staff at legal sea foods in framingham, ma for exceeding my expectations and making our dining enjoyable and memorable.  happy thanksgiving to all!  y.s. kim"
2017-11-19,Mell,1.0,"horrible food, messed up the bill, messed up the meals..gave wrong side orders. slow sunday lunch hour but the service took forever and waited for over an hour for a meal. they gave the bread after we had been sitting for a solid 20 minutes. small portions and waiter with australian accent touched the rims of the glasses with his dirty hands every time he refilled them. bill was almost 200 dollars and food and service was absolutely disgraceful!!"
2017-11-19,LarryA,5.0,"i love legals and go back whenever i can. our server chase was outstanding ! food is always fantastic. water was actually luke warm. love legals !

2017-11-18,bdrose,5.0,"was much better than the last few legal sea foods i've been to, all of which were in ny state.  only blip was my oysters were served with the slip of paper indicating which was which actually sitting right on top of one of the oysters, wet with the oyster juice."
2017-11-18,Delicious,4.0,legal in framingham is always a good bet for quality food. the host/ess station is always well manned and well organized. the service has never been bad. they use a team approach with expediters to get the food out hot and quickly. it is not as expensive as some alternatives with lesser quality food and service
2017-11-18,PamelaL,5.0,met an old friend for saturday lunch. you were able to comply with food allergies and the food was excellent. we received very good service and it was a good location for us to meet up and catch up. thanks
2017-11-17,YSKim,5.0,"our server tyler was very attentive, courteous and efficient.  several of the staff members including managers ming and kevin came over to our table to greet us.  ming also treated us to a delicious plate of appetizers.  thank you very much for giving us an enjoyable dining experience.  y.s. kim"

2017-11-12,John,5.0,"great food. great service. great night
my wife and i enjoyed ourselves immensely 
thanks"
2017-11-11,Usahot,2.0,"the fish was very fresh, that's about it... you need more than that these days. the presentation was very pedestrian for the over priced food. mismatched wine pairings (imho), everything was bland... from the wilted spinach with zero seasoning, jasmine rice with no flavor, wet... not crispy calamari... stingy on the roll basket and butter.... the worst fake bananas foster we've ever had... reminded us of something a 1st graders would make by themselves after school. in fairness the crab cake appetizer was excellent!  these guys need to rethink what's going on around them and stop resting on their laurels. give me ostra any day for the same money!!"
2017-11-11,David,5.0,our server was very nice and wicked cool. he connected with me on the levels on certain foods with the menu which i️ was all appreciated for. i️ enjoyed the time with my date. i’d come back and ask for the server again who i️ sadly forgot his name.
2017-11-11,YSKim,5.0,"nelson, who served our table, was attentive, efficient and professional.  this was the first time we had him and he exceeded our expectation.  lisa and ming, managers came to our table to chat.  my business partner and i highly recommend the legal sea foods in framingham for delicious meals and superb service.  thanks for making the dining there very enjoyable and memorable.  y.s. kim"
2017-11-10,KathyC,4.0,legals is a favorite - although this location needs a facelift badly - it takes away from the fantastic food
2017-11-10,TripAdvisor,5.0,another excellent meal here... so good.  tonight had a lobster with a baked pot. and cole slaw... perfectly done.  a bottle of sonoma cutrer chard... loved it.
2017-11-09,MJBK,3.0,"server was excellent but food quality was not so good. tasteless scallops, bland rice and undercooked spinach. not worth the lofty price. will not be going back anytime soon."
2017-11-09,Gbell,5.0,"great food, great drinks and great service.  legal seafood is my favorite ""go to"" restaurant."
2017-11-09,Jace1,4.0,"as with a number of the suburban legal seafoods, this one, too, is showing its age.  a decorating re-do is long overdo.  that being said, however, the food is always incomparably good  with service to match."
2017-11-08,Ballou,5.0,"sergey was our waiter so our service was excellent as usual. (even with a trainee in tow!) two seasonal offerings made our lunch choices extra special: butternut squash and pumpkin cheesecake for dessert.  great restaurant with a seasoned staff. our host, pat, was cordial as usual."
2017-11-08,pelli,4.0,"great service and food.  this is one of my favorite places to go as a celiac for gluten free food.  i have never gotten sick here!  i was especially impressed this time because when i got my food, the server noted that my meal was gf (without me having to confirm) and that it was prepared separately.  i really appreciate that because then i can just enjoy my food and not wonder if i am going to pay for it tomorrow and the day after.  delicious food too! thank you!"
2017-11-05,foodlover,3.0,"service was good, but food is overpriced and definitely not worth it. i got the stuffed shrimp and it came out burnt. the shrimp was dry and the side of broccoli was not cooked. the positive is that the atmosphere is nice and they have an extensive wine list."
2017-11-04,JoshC,5.0,consistently good. if you like sushi the entrée portion of the blackened tuna sashimi is a great choice.
2017-11-02,YSKim,5.0,"i was at the restaurant with deb for our monthly get-together.  sonya and amanda served us on their last day at the legal sea foods in framingham and we had an opportunity to say thank you for their exemplary service and to say good bye.  i will be challenged to find a server-team as good as sonya-amanda.  my sincere thanks to all the staff members for making my dining experience fun, special and wonderful!  y.s. kim"
2017-11-02,HKinFraminham,5.0,fresh seafood and decent portions.  service was great but a bit too much up selling of the desserts.  even asked our party if we wanted any desserts to go when we said no.
2017-11-02,kurt,5.0,great fried clams. cooked to perfection. great waitstaff(pam).
2017-11-02,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"my comments don't reflect the best experience since our young granddaughters were with us. i highly recommend dining without the ""kids"" since the food is outstanding, and the service is impeccable, along with a good wine list. tending to small children takes away from the enjoyment of the experience. we'll definitely return for a nice adults only evening.

2017-11-02,foodfan,2.0,"one of the party has numerous food allergies. the server did not know the menu or how things were cooked well enough to give a suggestion. luckily, the manager stepped in and guided the cooking of the meal to avoid certain concerning food types. unfortunately, the meal was very delayed which made three hungry women get more annoyed as time went on.
did not feel that the sides were up to usual standards, but the fish was delicious.
the place is too noisy for a quiet conversation among the group."
2017-11-02,JaneM,4.0,great lunch place. met for a business engagement. would go back. you can never go wrong with lsf
2017-10-30,proudparent,5.0,"always a great place for dinner. the framingham restaurant features a more traditional seafood menu, but even the non-seafood eater found something to enjoy."
2017-10-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"overall our dining experience was off the chart. we did experience a couple of issues not really that big of a deal, but our first issue was our reservation was nearly 15 mins delayed before we were seated. the second issue was one of our guests was unable to join us for dinner however, asked us to bring them a bowl of clam chowder and when we got home to find out we received a cup instead. that was a bit disappointing, we drove 30 mins, if we were closer i would of corrected the matter. thank you for giving me an opportunity to air my issues."
2017-10-28,EvaK,5.0,my husband and i met with friends for dinner.  everyone was happy with their food. one member in the group had food allergies which were addressed and had their food delivered by a certified food preparer.  i was impressed.
2017-10-28,Ellie,5.0,lovely food. good service.
2017-10-28,hiroBonn,5.0,"good foods, whenever i come to farmingham on business trip, i always come to the restraunt.
i love it."
2017-10-27,GR8place,3.0,"the service was professionally delivered but no personality or enthusiasm.  not that we wanted an extended conversation, but some form of warm welcome to the establishment.  the two fish dinners just didn't seem as good as we've had at other legal locations, could just be us, but the skin on the bottom of haddock just seemed ""fishy"".  the dessert was outstanding blood sorbet. best part of the meal."
2017-10-27,Valeria,5.0,had a great experience as always . amazing food and service
2017-10-26,Rulade,5.0,great food & excellent service. dinner with our daughter was a perfect ending to our short stay in massachusetts.
2017-10-25,PattyP,4.0,wonderfully fresh seafood!  the swordfish special with blue cheese crumbles on a bed of impossibly fresh greens was outstanding and perfectly balanced with walnuts and pears.
2017-10-21,Geoff,4.0,"little things: dessert served with whipped cream on top and listed as on a raspberry sauce, but the tiny amount of sauce is on top of whipped cream... on the side. ask for more raspberry sauce... am brought raspberry vinaigrette !! whoa

nice waiter, but he should have used his knowledge of the food to avoid that snafu. he even commented on it after i pointed out to him the two sauces had different color gradients and compositions!! 

have gone for a while... a bowl of chowder is now $9.95!! come on... really? they sell it in stores! they make it by the tanker truck full... i’ll never buy it at those prices.. it’s a turn off."
2017-10-18,TripAdvisor,5.0,another great meal here.  the service and chow excellent as usual. my shrimp cocktail and crab cakes with a glass of while wine... bliss.
2017-10-18,John,4.0,service was good. clam chowder was exceptional. the carrots in the salad were rock hard. asked for italian dressing and balsamic was served on it. the fried fish lightly battered but tough and tasteless. overall for the price paid it was not worth it. i could have gone to kelly’s and got better food for 75% the price. i was embarrassed when my father in law grabbed the bill and said it was way too expensive for what we got.
2017-10-15,TishaM,2.0,after 2 spoons of soup our dinner arrived.  we wanted to send it back but it wasn't what we ordered because they were out of what we ordered and just sent out something without telling us.  we didn't want what they cooked and finally got to order our own meal.  won't go back.
2017-10-15,CindyH,1.0,"always been a fan of legals, but they changed their menu this week and now don't let you pick the sides, it is predetermined. if you are spending $30+ for fish you should be able to pick your sides without being charged a change fee."
2017-10-14,GinnyA,3.0,"we arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were kept waiting well past our reservation time. our server tyler was ok ,but not exceptional. never asked what sides we wanted so i had to chase him down. he followed up nicely though. 
the food was great, as usual."
2017-10-14,nick,4.0,only complaint was waiter took the paid bill from the table before we were ready to leave which usually doesn't happen. we took it as a hint to leave. we were there no more than an hour.
2017-10-14,PriscillaG,5.0,never a disappointment.  always great food and service.
2017-10-11,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"our group of 4 had excellent seafood dinners with very good service. draft beer is a little pricey, but we'll be back!"
2017-10-09,Cathy,5.0,very attentive waitress   our dinner was delicious.  overall it was a great dinner
2017-10-08,BobW,5.0,"kevin, the manager is outstanding. always smiling, always ready to help!"
2017-10-08,dewy42,5.0,the food is always outstanding. we met with friends who were here from the west coast and the wife is originally from ma. she was happy to hit legal's before flying home and got the lob-stah! her husband had never been there before and raved about the portuguese stew. my husband got the crab cake and he said the cole slaw was the best he ever had; i ordered the seafood casserole - just wonderful!
2017-10-08,JimmyV56,4.0,"legal sea foods has been around for a very long time and we've been regular diners although this was our 1st visit to the framingham location.  the food was outstanding. the raw cotuit oysters were as fresh as i've ever had and the cioppino was excellent, chock full of shrimp, scallops, mussels and calamari. and while the lobster claw on top was a nice touch, it appears to have sat in a steam table so long that the meat was shriveled beyond recognition.  the service was attentive if uneven, seems that getting drinks from the bar took longer than should be expected so i'm not sure if that falls on the server or the bar staff. i do know the bar was packed with patrons with a few tv's displaying various sporting events. overall the quality of the food would make me return, perhaps during the week when the restaurant activity wasn't as energetic."
2017-10-07,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we had a reservation for four on saturday night for my son’s birthday. we were originally seated at a nice spacious booth and had my daughter in high chair at the end. after being seated and given our menus we were abruptly approached that we had to move as the high chair was in a walkway. due to fire code we could not have a high chair there. so we were moved to a table which would have been completely fine. however, we were jammed into a back room with a large party of 12. we could barely get to our table and it was hard to talk. unfortunately this was disappointing as there were other tables that might have been better suited for us."
2017-10-06,PamC,4.0,"we had a group reservation for 7 for lunch after a funeral service. the table in the more private dining room was perfect, except that the air conditioning was extremely cold."
2017-10-05,Dinner,5.0,great food and great service! it’s become our “go to” place to stop for a great meal on our way home from logan after travel
2017-10-04,TripAdvisor,5.0,"back for more.  shrimp cocktail, clam chowder to start... lobster and  king crab claws were the items we enjoyed tonight.  excellent service.  a nice evening."
2017-10-03,gigi,5.0,appreciated the gluten free accommodation! amanda was terrifi!
2017-10-02,Okbutnowow,5.0,have not been to boston in awhile.  dinner was excellent - i forgot how good the food was and i will definitely go back.
2017-10-01,Mimsey,4.0,shrimp over cooked; noisy; lots of traffic around table
2017-10-01,Carol,5.0,"as usual the food is reliably superb.
i had the oysters which were baked, one friend had the cod and the other had the sole. service was pleasant , although a bit slow."
2017-09-30,deeboston,5.0,"even if legal's is right on overcrowded route 9 and part of a restaurant chain, it is a great place to mark a family milestone. we went here to celebrate my husband's and his mother's birthdays. it was a treat - everyone liked their dishes and the service was very good."
2017-09-30,lofamily,5.0,"we loved just about everything at our saturday dinner here. waiter was professional and had a good sense of humor and nice personality. food was simply prepared but with fresh ingredients and thoughtful presentation.  portions were mostly generous although 4 asparagus spears seemed skimpy for a side that cost extra, and celery in ice-filled bloody mary left little to drink.  convenient parking, nice decor, comfortable booth."
2017-09-29,aussieva,4.0,"had a gift card but have been to legals before at other locations.  went for the oysters - excellent.  i had the tuna - excellent, med rare with spinach and rice (too much rice).  husband had grilled assortment. good selection but way too much food.  but we did try dessert - apple crumble which was excellent. chocolate mousse was not mousse but almost cake like.  did taste good but again way too much. we are of the crowd that would like less food. usually we order a main to split, but didn't this time, our bad. we normally take it home.   love the service and we know that it is a crowded restaurant. husband's glass of wine took  a while to get to him, but overall good service."
2017-09-28,John,5.0,the food was delicious and the service great!! best cod ever!!
2017-09-28,RogerB,4.0,"this was my first visit to this location and enjoyed the experience. although a little on the pricey side, i will consider a return visit."
2017-09-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we love legal.  good anytime! consistantly  wonderful ,fresh and perfectly prepared.  always good attentive service"
2017-09-26,SandyB,5.0,our server was excellent.  she noted our requests and met them all.  she was attentive to us throuout the meal.
2017-09-25,Liketoeatout,3.0,"we are usually much more pleased with legal than this time.  my husband's allergies are usually handled perfectly, however this time, the rice had to be sent back as there was some broccoli mixed in and that was listed as one of his allergies. in addition, 3 of the 4 of us had their meals brought out at the same time, but the 4th diner had to wait 5 minutes longer for her meal. 
the bill was incorrect as the salad was supposed to be 1/2 size and the price was for a full size salad. 
this was not what kind of service we are used to when we go to legal.  i guess it was an off night. although the restaurant was busy, there were many empty tables, so not sure why things didn't go more smoothly."
2017-09-24,AmyW,1.0,"spent a few days in the area for a business trip.  finally had some free time saturday evening and decided to take myself to a nice dinner. was seated later than expected even though i had a reservation...ok...no big deal.  the waiter was nice enough (at first) and i ordered a glass of wine and the surf and turf.  the waiter servicing the table behind me was amazing! he was outgoing and personable and even listed off the evenings specials to the table.  my waiter never even gave me any specials! my meal arrived rather blah looking (f for presentation).  just a small steak which looked like leather and a lobster (in the shell) on a plate. when i started to remove my lobster it was all full of that green ""stuff"".  the waiter came over and i explained to him that i could not eat it and that the look of it was a total turn off for me.  the waiter was completely rude, grabbed my plate and told me in his huff then i should've ordered it ""lazy mans style"".  wow, really?!  i didn't even know there was a such a thing.  i didn't expect to get a lobster full of gunk at what's supposed to be a nice restaurant! the manager came to the table and was also rude.  i explained that the waiter didn't even give me the specials of the evening and that he huffed something at me about ""lazy mans style"" while taking my plate away.  the manager did not apologize.  the manager said well yeah, that's what you should've done.  i'm not from these parts.  i had no idea that was even a thing! to top things off, the side plate with my (not) baked potato and practically raw asparagus were also inedible.   the manager did not offer to compensate my meal, he did not offer to get me anything else, he said, i'll be back with your bill.  i was in shock! are you seriously giving me a bill!? luckily, he only charged me for my 1 glass of wine and i truly don't believe he should've! a good manager would not have charged me for that wine. customer service and satisfaction are dead here!"
2017-09-23,OpenTable Diner,1.0,server unfamiliar with bar offerings. ordered appetizer that never came. entrees plated very messy and unattractive.  poor quality experience
2017-09-21,Patticake,5.0,"we had a very good meal with attentive and accurate service.  the noise level was a bit high, but not deafening."
2017-09-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,i was in for a college visit to boston. being able to go to legal sea food was definitely a highlight of the trip. when i was younger i had eaten here before and was so pleased to see the quality and taste i remembered.
2017-09-20,Mike,4.0,we eat there often and try something different.  i had fried shrimp which was very good.  overall an enjoyable evening.
2017-09-19,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"overated, overpriced, ill-prepared food, poor value."
2017-09-17,Sydney,2.0,"we've been to legals many times.  we're finding that the quality of food is declining and the prices increasing -
very disappointing.  the service was very confused -
several different wait staff helped us and no one communicated with anyone else"
2017-09-16,Roger,5.0,we always get excellent food and service. a favorite go-to place.
2017-09-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great food, great service! legal seafoods caters to gluten free requirements very well."
2017-09-16,phlh,2.0,ordered the king crab legs and they came out tasting old and very dry. i was surprised as i had this meal there before and it was excellent. this time around i was very disappointed. i would have ordered something else.
2017-09-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we had super good company around our table! everyone was nice to us, from the hostess to the management. very enjoyable experience, will be returning."
2017-09-15,marjo,4.0,"been to this legal many times. came again for special oyster season. appetizers were great - oysters legal and shrimp, wine by the glass also variable and good for the price. main courses, the sides, mashed, rice, cole slaw and veggies were also good as usual. the problem however was main course of halibut steaks which we both ordered. streaks were nice and thick and white, but, they were way over cooked and dry. very disappointing since we both ordered for main course. kitchen was very busy and these halibuts must have been cooking way before we ordered them and left to bake too long.
wine was good though!"
2017-09-15,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"the raw oysters were good, but the cooked oysters were just ok and overpriced.  the lobster prices are absurd, so i had fried seafood. which was salty and overcooked to the point of being shriveled. the waitress was nice but prone to disappearing for significant periods.

overall, they are nowhere near what legal seafood should be."
2017-09-09,GinnyA,4.0,"our server, lisa,  was very good and attentive.  the lobster and one baked potato cane out cold. management handled that issue immediately. over all it was a good experience."
2017-09-09,BobfromMetrowest,5.0,as usual food was very good. waiter pair constant attention. i have a son with severe food allergies and they were accommodating and manager and chef delivered food to make sure all was set.
2017-09-08,KilgoreTrout,5.0,"i am always impressed by the professional way legal seafood deals with allergies which members of my family present to our server.   food is almost always uniform in presentation so you always know what you are getting, and every dish is very good in quality."
2017-09-08,Malloy,5.0,"we're very been here before and had high expectations, which were meet. the seafood is the best around. we had haddock and grilled scallops. the chowder is always exceptional."
2017-09-08,Knitter,5.0,"bluefish was outstanding, as was our server. excellent value for quality food."
2017-09-06,OpenTable Diner,5.0,took my wife here for our anniversary this place was great. it’s was really busy that night and we still got amazing service. the waiter was the best gave us plenty of time never rushed us. the food was awesome i and the crab cakes and scallops cooked perfectly. my wife had the swordfish which she loved. i would recommend this place to anyone that wants a great meal and great service.
2017-09-05,TripAdvisor,5.0,"excellent chow, as usual.  been coming here for years and a lot recently.  so reliable.  excellent grilled shrimp dish tonight.  great service, wine."
2017-09-03,OpenTable Diner,5.0,consistently great seafood prepared  to perfection.
2017-09-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"stopped on our way to a concert in boston - legal's waterfront restaurants were all booked for the time we wanted, happy we thought to catch this one on the way into town.  legal service is always excellent, and we were happy with our server's pleasant demeanor and professional service despite the very busy saturday night. fisherman's platter and seafood mixed grill dishes were bountiful and tasty. also enjoyed the option of wine flights, served with a card for notes. several options for side dishes is always appreciated, especially for the fried dinners, though not sure the kale was worth an add-on cost as a ""premium side.""  there are cheaper options locally for seafood, but the quality and service of all the legal restaurants can always be depended upon."
2017-09-02,Fantastic,5.0,best food we have ever had at legal.  grilled scallops and shrimp especially.
2017-09-02,julianal,4.0,seafood casserole was delicious!  oysters as well. excellent option!
2017-09-01,Rose,5.0,great service from the time i walked in till the time we left. food was delicious as usual !
2017-09-01,YSKim,5.0,"our server bianca, who has been added to the  legal sea foods in framingham, was courteous, efficient and effective.  have a fun career, bianca!  y.s. kim"
2017-08-31,JonB,4.0,"we chose legal to celebrate our anniversary - good call. it feels a bit special, without breaking the bank.
we had drinks at home, so no need to stop at the bar. they seated us right away with our reservation.
at the table, i ordered an omagang rare vos amber ale - a real special beer for a special night, and at a reasonable price. we shared a bowl of lobster bisque. this was the real thing: rich, flavorful and creamy without too much sherry to hide the flavor or too much flour thickener. just right.
my wife had a special with crab cake, shrimp and scallops over a salad. excellently cooked, and enough so that she had some seafood for lunch the next day. i had a tuna steak cooked sashimi style - extremely rare. it was cooked perfectly, but, i felt it was under-seasoned. next time, i'll add a rub or a sauce (available at no charge).
we were full up, so no blueberry strussel for dessert, but, we were tempted!
throughout, our server was great: knowledgeable about the menu, chatted about anniversaries and kids, a really nice person.
they made it a special evening."
2017-08-31,outtoeat459,5.0,always consistent and reliably the best seafood worth the price.
2017-08-29,4GoodEats,3.0,obscenely busy place with high noise levels and large parties. parking is a challenge. service was great but food was below par. menu is dated offering the usual legal options. fish chowder is very heavy cream and didn't have any fish chunks. clams were weird tasting and the alaskan crab legs were tasteless unless you dip them into butter.
2017-08-29,JOHN,3.0,"we were a party of 5 and of the food was very good. everyone really enjoyed the food except me. i ordered fried clams and they were very disappointing.  they were overcooked, very dry and crunchy. i probably should have sent them back. when you've been around in new england as long as they have and not make decent fried clams, well, it's just disappointing. as i said previously, everything else was very good with ample portions."
2017-08-28,Tina,2.0,"sadly, legal is no longer a sure bet for an upscale seafood dining experience. service (on a monday night) was extremely slow and fairly inattentive.  food is significantly overpriced for small to average portions.  'lemon' salmon special ($28) was completely dry, with absolutely no seasoning whatsoever. shrimp in cold shrimp noodle special ($25) were completely rubbery.  dinner for our family of four - 2 ice teas, no alcohol and one shared appetizer - was over $150 with tip. very disappointing."
2017-08-28,YSKim,5.0,"as always, the restaurant staff members at the legal sea foods in framingham ma were warm, courteous, and professional.  

manager in charge for the evening came over to our table greeting us and gave us a delicious dessert on the house.  our server sonya was very effective and efficient.  

even though she and her partner amanda were very busy, they took the time to come over to our table checking up on us to make sure we're having a wonderful dining experience.

thank you very much for the spectacular dining experience, everyone at the legal.  y.s. kim"
2017-08-27,TripAdvisor,5.0,"legal is such a solid choice for a fine meal.  the whole family loves it here.  my son grew up dining here and over the years has graduated from mac and cheese to shrimp cocktail, crab cakes and lobster.  all of these items were delicious tonight as well as the everything tuna.  so good!"
2017-08-27,KatieD,5.0,"this is a family favorite, especially when my sisters (who live in ny and ca) visit and are in need of some classic new england seafood! the noise level is moderate, especially in the bar. when it's not too busy to get a table in the main dining area, we prefer to sit there. we like eating here, especially because we are usually able to grab a reservation on opentable, even at the last-minute, which is especially helpful when we are on the way to the movie theater! my favorite dish is the seafood casserole, but last time i tried the anna's baked boston cod, which was also delicious. the sides are seasonal, but my the butternut squash is the best! also, their sangria is one of the best i've ever had! (visited 10/13/18, 7/23/16 and 1/20/18)"
2017-08-26,Clau,4.0,our waitress was amazing!  the food was very good too except for my dish (rice bowl with salmon and kimchee).  it didn't indicate anywhere that it would be super spicy!  i would have returned it but didn't want to hold the dinner up for everyone.
2017-08-25,EHank,4.0,very attentive service from our waiter without being intrusive. crab cake appetizer still consistently good. the salmon special and the almond encrusted salmon both were seasoned well and not over cooked. the blueberry tarte dessert was too sweet. overall a good dining experience. one of the better legal sea foods.
2017-08-24,Ballou,5.0,amanda was special as always. enjoyed the faroe island salmon with mushroom ravioli and spinach. delicious! the wife had the same salmon with mashed and broccoli. we topped off the meal with boston cream pie! you can't beat the service and quality of legal!
2017-08-23,Hoosierdiners,3.0,we were here on vacation and had eaten at a legal seafood 6 years ago (near the aquarium in boston) and we were so impressed we thought we would try this one since we were in the area. we sort of felt rushed through our dinner and the overall experience in food quality and atmosphere did not compare at all with the other location.
2017-08-22,Cody64,5.0,food was absolutely delicious. the thai calamari was perfect. the service was very good. it was our 30th anniversary and we made a good choice for dinner. it's a bit noisy but it was very busy.
2017-08-21,TripAdvisor,5.0,"i always head to legal when i am looking for a solid, reliable meal.  tonight, no exception.  excellent chow, wine, service in a pleasing atmosphere.  i was craving their shrimp cocktail, so good.  everything tuna stood out tonight. our server, dan, provided great service."
2017-08-21,JamesC,4.0,carlos our waiter was one of the best in a long time. very busy but always came back to make sure everything was to perfection.
2017-08-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"when my wife and i started dating, she lived in boston and i in connecticut.  we used to meet every wednesday and eat at legal in framingham. every meal we've had there has been perfect, and we absolutely love the waitstaff.  we have now been married for almost a year and we still never go more than a month without eating there, despite it being a 90 minute drive.  i give this restaurant my highest rating."
2017-08-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great sea food. menu needs to be updated with new dishes.
2017-08-18,Aqua5,5.0,"as always, a great time with great food at legal. they are one of the freshest and most consistent seafood restaurants you'll ever find. i think i've had one problem in over 15 years of going there and it was fixed quickly by excellent management. the staff is always nice. food is always top notch. ambience and decor is perfect and it's just an all around great place. i try to get here 18-20 times a year and it's worth every penny!!!!"
2017-08-14,BillSierra,4.0,"our server tom r #201399 was amazing. he was very attentive and had a very strong knowledge of the menu. 

the rhode island calamari were incredible!"
2017-08-13,Chris,5.0,"as usual, our meal was excellent. i had the seafood casserole and my dining companions had the chef's choice grilled fish. we all had salads beforehand - nice and fresh. it was my wife's birthday, so they gave her a free desert. we had decaf for desert - a very dark roast that might not be to everyone's taste, but i enjoyed it. our waiter was attentive and pleasant throughout. there's a good reason we keep coming back here."
2017-08-11,Macats,5.0,"i have dined at this location before and liked it very much. again, i was not disappointed. there were five of us out to celebrate a birthday. the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was very good. 
i will not hesitate to return."
2017-08-11,Formanro,5.0,"we decided on legals for dinner and very happy we did.   the food is amazing, the service is the best, and we especially loved the calamari... it was wonderful!!!"
2017-08-09,diner,4.0,"always reliable, with many good choices. the world's best shrimp cocktail."
2017-08-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great oysters and popcorn shrimp ! a plus for the martini . main dish was average , probably ordered the wrong plate , three small pieces of fish over cooked . sides of fries ok , onion straws were greasy -- should have ordered veggies !"
2017-08-08,Ballou,5.0,we were thrilled to have nicole as our server! late lunch / early dinner consisted of faroe island salmon grilled in lemon vinaigrette with sides of mashed potato and broccoli with cheese. i added a skewer of shrimp. desert was boston cream pie-a legal speciality. our host pat made sure we felt welcome. legal in framingham is always a great choice!
2017-08-06,reneh,5.0,great food and wait staff!
2017-08-06,MAbud,2.0,basically we didn't get any service from the waiter that evening.  he just took our order and gave us the bill.  the waiter didn't even check with us if the meals we ordered was okay or not.  ended up my friend had to eat the crab cake as crab cake sandwich because it was too salty.  i also ordered a decaf cappuccino but it wasn't decaf.  i ended up awake all night.  i would return but i would request other waiter for sure.
2017-08-05,TripAdvisor,5.0,"back again to legal.  perhaps the top spot in the general area.  always consistent and satisfying.  loved my steamed lobster and started with the fantastic shrimp cocktail.  others enjoyed crab cakes, salads, halibut."
2017-08-02,jjmjjj,4.0,we had a great birthday dinner at legal seafood.  the food was fresh and delicious.
2017-08-02,GMoney,5.0,i made a reservation to celebrate my mothers birthday and my own. the table was not ready when we got there. once we were seated the service was awesome. some of us were kindly allowed to taste a few of the wines before deciding on a wine. the food was incredible. my favorite restaurant in the area.
2017-07-31,Foodfan,3.0,"always reliably interesting and well-prepared seafood. i enjoyed six oysters from duxbury, which were flavorful and fresh as the sea. my wild(!) salmon (not farm-raised), a special for the evening, was delicious. the fish and chips were good, though the fries tended to be a bit soggy. i wonder if it would help if they were in a dish separate from the fish? the grilled asparagus that came with my salmon, however, was a disappointment. as i suggested to the waiter and the front desk, they should always snap off the woody and largely inedible lower part of asparagus. finally, the noise level was just barely tolerable and it was good finally to get back outside where our ears could recuperate. sadly, noise seems to be commonplace in many restaurants."
2017-07-31,Knitbee,5.0,what an awesome evening. carlos was our waiter. he was so attentive to our 16 year old grandson as well as his grandpa who was celebrating his birthday. he went out of his way with special service. the meals were all yummy.
2017-07-31,bogartdad,5.0,"when i have a business lunch or frankly any meal worth making an occasion, i always got to legal.  the food, the service, and the atmosphere always make it a great time. i heartily recommend it to anyone as their seafood isn't just good, it's legal! the quality shows in every dish. can't wait to go back!"
2017-07-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,outstanding as usual. our server quincy was particularly attentive and made great suggestions.
2017-07-28,GwennO,5.0,we have gone to this legals often and it never disappoints. it's always a great meal with friendly wait staff. we've gone to a few legal seafoods in ma and the framingham restaurant is definitely one of the best. great for an evening out or pre or post movie.
2017-07-28,Carol,5.0,artic char was superb! house salad very fresh with excellent tomato balsamac vinegar dressing.  broccoli done perfectly.
2017-07-28,Jack,5.0,"great food and value

2017-07-27,LynnM,3.0,we love legals and we go back again and again. our only complaint is that latel
2017-07-27,Gbell,5.0,"as always, legal provides fabulous food and drinks with super service!  it is noisy, but that's what you'd expect from such a large restaurant.  you get the same consistent food and service from every location."
2017-07-27,Fisco,4.0,"legal is consistent in quality, delivers the best crab cakes and chowder.
ma oysters are not at the level of the other oysters available in the us.
service is efficient and personalized.
strongly recommended."
2017-07-24,TonyT,3.0,the grilled shrimp was very good.  the grilled asparagus had the woody ends attached and overcooked.
2017-07-22,Fester,3.0,"food is good albeit overpriced. smallish but sufficient portions. my biggest beef: bartenders won't recognize you if you're not seated at the bar - a problem getting a drink when bar is crowded. otherwise, has a factory feel to it - all the servers wearing earpieces,  a million of them running around doing this and that. feels like the place has gotten too big for its own good. that said, our waitress was very nice and efficient."
2017-07-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we always enjoy coming here. food was great and our waitress alyssa was fantastic. only reason for not giving 5 stars was that the kitchen was a little slow. but then again it was packed. no complaints here!
2017-07-22,luvcm60,5.0,food and service were wonderful. legals is good for any occasion!
2017-07-22,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"for a restaurant known for it's high standards of quality, this was quite a disappointing dining experience.  although this was my first visit in a while, i have been frequenting this location for almost 20 years.  i hope i can chalk it up to an ""off night"" and that this hasn't become the norm.  of the 3 appetizers we had, 2 tasted like they were a bit ""past their prime"" and the third was incredibly greasy, dripping with oil.  the grilled fish entrees were all dry and overcooked, the sides were bland and under seasoned, there were special requests made that were confirmed but not delivered/executed, and the baked-stuffed lobster was only split and stuffed halfway down.  i will probably go back at some point and hope for a better result, but it was clear that there was an overall lack of attention to detail on this occasion.  given the reputation and the price point, this visit fell short."
2017-07-22,OpenTable Diner,1.0,fish and chips was disgusting. server didn't even offer to take it off the bill or have a manager come over. won't be returning and do not recommend.
2017-07-21,Kevin,3.0,"good good, very slow service"
2017-07-19,Mike,3.0,clam chowder was as delicious as always.  we had the salmon special which was just ok.

2017-07-17,robles101,4.0,easy parking. prompt greeting and seating with reservation. personable waiter. conscientious response to specific requests. tasty food. interesting specials.
2017-07-15,phyllisp,5.0,"the bartender was so great! he came around the bar to get our drinks order while we waited for our high top table. how many bartenders would do that!
i had made a reservation for a high top for 7 pm and i must say they did not honor our request and we waited 45 minutes. that was the down side.
our food was excellent, as usual, and our waiter was excellent."
2017-07-14,AMDines,3.0,"we come here frequently and usually are very happy with both the food and the service . this friday night 7/14 everything was off. forgot our appetizer, food was greasy, service terrible.people are either on vacation or the chef is new or something else is wrong."
2017-07-14,TripAdvisor,5.0,"more excellent chow.  back again after just a few  days.  loved my shrimp cocktail as usual.  for something different tried the chicken wings.  good, but prob won't have again as there are better items.  service excellent."
2017-07-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,our waitress was amazing. very quick and hard working
2017-07-11,Heironymus,2.0,"noise level beyond acceptable, conversation not possible.
mussel appetizer: the 1/2 above the broth were dried out, the lower half and broth were good.
fried clam meal was served with french fries underneath the clams. no good as i want to salt and pepper my fries but not my clams. by the time i found our waitress and got a separate order of fries, the clams had cooled off and were then pasty and inedible.
wifes crab cakes she said were good with a lot of crab meat.
seems like they're trading on the name and not good food."
2017-07-11,YSKim,5.0,"as always, our meals were prepared well and delivered to us timely."
2017-07-09,DeeNee,5.0,"we were very happy with the quality food at legal - we have grown to expect it and were not disappointed.  we asked for a table not on the main drag for servers.  once relocated, the service was attentive but not too attentive.   in addition to good food, legal has an excellent wine list."
2017-07-09,YSKim,5.0,"our server was friendly, courteous and professional.  our meals were prepared well and delivered timely."
2017-07-08,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal here.  tonight started with a very nice margarita (was in the mood)... clam chowder, grilled shrimp perfectly cooked.  always some sonoma cutrer chardonnay when im here... excellent service."

how can anyone turn down delicious ice cream bon bons!"
2017-07-08,connie,3.0,"we were disappointed in our meal at legals. my husband had the seafood platter, which has always been his favorite. the seafood was soggy and they forgot to give him clams. the waiter brought them but they were soggy. i had baked fish which was ordinary. the strawberry shortcake was good."
2017-07-07,YSKim,5.0,"the staff members at legal sea foods in framingham were warm, cordial and professional.  as always, our meals were prepared to our liking and served to us timely.  the server did an excellent job.  many thanks for our wonderful dining experience!  y.s. kim"
2017-07-04,YSKim,5.0,our server did an excellent job of making sure that our meals were prepared to our order and delivered to our table in a timely manner.
2017-07-04,Lauren,2.0,"horrible service. the framingham restaurant has chronic mismanagement issues. poor training of staff, understaffing, meals arrive untimed at the table with multiple guests, wrong orders with allergy orders, etc. managers always try to fix but at the end your meal is ultimately delayed and ruined. i keep giving this legals another try to only be disappointed again."
2017-07-02,GFdiner,5.0,"i had a wonderful gluten free meal of fish and chips!  it is so rare to find a dedicated fryer.  i thoroughly enjoyed every bite. the gluten free rolls were also exceptional in taste and texture.  the waiter was outstanding, knowledgeable and so very helpful in making the meal choices."
2017-07-01,OpenTable Diner,4.0,cherrystone clams were fresh with the taste of the sea . entrees were tasty per usual and good to have available more green vegetable choices rather than the usual starchy choices.
2017-07-01,MarieC,4.0,dad's 92nd birthday
2017-06-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,as always this restaurant is an old reliable and professionally run and always sure to impress. i must say that i thought the condition of the physical plant has really gone down hill and it is in need of a serious upgrade if it is going to continue to compete with all the new our options. but the service and the food were top notch.
2017-06-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"not cheap.  food is good.  service was good, except we waited an eternity to get the bill."
2017-06-26,Cynthia,5.0,"love legal, they bend over backwards to please you, and they do - from chef to waitstaff!

great cocktails in ""adult"" size glasses as well!

thank you roger for maintaining your standards - you are unique!"
2017-06-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"very happy with the prompt seating we received. had a corner table allowing us to sit close but with ample room for food plates.
very good service, hot food prepared just as expected."
2017-06-24,CapeCodVisitor,4.0,"great attention paid to the gluten-free meal.  another meal was more well-done then expected, reorder arrived with-in minutes.  wonderful service.  delicious food. lingered over coffee without feeling rushed."

2017-06-24,YSKim,5.0,"as always, the restaurant staff was welcoming, courteous and professional.  our server was attentive and efficient.  my family and i were celebrating my nephew's birthday and we felt welcome and special.  thank you very much for making our dining experience memorable."
2017-06-24,DLsfavorite,5.0,"excellent meal as usual!  the caesar salad and rolls are very good.
the seafood casserole is my favorite.  my wife had the crab cake combo and loved it."
2017-06-22,NboroGirl,4.0,"i don't eat seafood, but we often take out-of-town seafood lovers here. everyone loves the seafood. i ordered the marinated grilled chicken. i'm not sure what it was marinated in, but it was 2 bland chicken breast pieces that were flavorless. it came with yummy mashed potatoes which were creamy and smooth, and a generous helping of broccoli which was also bland, and also had brown areas so i doubt it was fresh. i've had the steak here in the past, which was very good. i guess i'll be ordering it next time since i won't be getting the chicken ever again.

service was good, albeit a little slow.  the place is very noisy inside and it made conversation difficult."
2017-06-21,Waylandguy,4.0,we thoroughly enjoyed out meals.  the cioppino is one of my absolute favorites and always pleases!
2017-06-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"end of the school year dinner. great food and conversation. also, great margaritas."
2017-06-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"it is so gratifying to be able to choose from so many fried seafood options which are gluten free. while i am gluten intolerant, neither my husband or kids are. the food can be shared and tastes great! highly recommend to those who wonder how good can it be? try it!"
2017-06-18,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"it took 45 minutes for our lunch-fare to come out and it was just soup and appetizers. i guess the kids each had a lobster, but a boiled lobster takes what, 10 - 15 minutes to cook. the bread came out late as well. the food was very good, but not great. more of a dinner place imo. had eaten here previously."
2017-06-18,sanibelbound,3.0,we had the clam and shrimp appetizers and they were dry and overcooked. my seafood casserole was mostly chunks of white fish. other's dining with me all had the same experience. not an outstanding dinner. we've had better at legal sea foods. makes me wonder about their quality control of if perhaps they've diluted the brand opening so many restaurants.
2017-06-17,Dennyann,5.0,cookie is the best waitress there. she always delivers top notch device and food was excellent.
2017-06-17,Almills3,5.0,"graduation  and father's day meal. 

we enjoyed the meal."
2017-06-17,Tmac,5.0,"my favorite restaurant ,  consistently good food and service"
2017-06-17,rhpositive,3.0,legal is one of our favorite restaurants when we are in the area as there are none in our end of ma.  we usually have a great experience and very much enjoy the food.  this time it was not up to its usual caliber.  it took a very long time for us to receive our meals and when they came one was not as hot as it should have been.  it was taken back and replaced with a hot entree but that one was overcooked.  not what we have been accustomed to at legal but i am sure we will be back again in the future.....hopefully back to its normal excellence when we do.
2017-06-17,LaurenD,4.0,"very nice saturday lunch for a large party.  everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  i especially liked the bang bang  cauliflower appetizer and their tomato and manouri cheeses salad.  i appreciated the flexibility to substitute sides when ordering my lobster roll, but found the roll to be a less tasty version than the one i had at the harborside location - this one smaller and had more mayo."
2017-06-16,JanM,5.0,"excellent food.

2017-06-14,Eric,3.0,"this was not my first time at this legal's. the restaurant was very cold!! almost to the point if uncomfortable. 

staff were very attentive. 

my order was not prepared according to my expressed interest. they did provide a replacement though it made for a disjointed eating experience with my wife. i might have expected some adjustment on the bill as a gesture."
2017-06-13,BENNY,4.0,service was very slow this evening althogh food was very good.
2017-06-13,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the food was outstanding, wait staff fantastic,  however because it was so crowded for the middle of the week night our food took a little longer than normal, and our table seating area was a tad warmer than it should have been. we were smiling as the folks next to us were fanning themselves with folded up paper fans. 

as usual though, this is the place to be if you like great seafood!"
2017-06-13,CoppellSD,3.0,northeast seafood experience....must try while in the area.
2017-06-12,Sheldon,5.0,we purposely ordered chowder and salad to be able to get in and out quickly. i suspected the waiter forgot to put the order in but said the kitchen was backed up (strange given our order). we were similarly ignored when it came to other things. not offered the option of pepper whichbother legal waiter typically do. we've had good meals at legals before but this one was not. the fish chowder also was much lighter on fish than usual.
2017-06-12,YSKim,5.0,"our server tyler was friendly, efficient and professional.  it was very nice that manager lisa and other team members came to our table to say hello.  our meals were prepared and delivered to us in a timely manner.  legal sea foods in framingham is still my favorite restaurant.  y.s. kim"

very disappointed as you can see."
2017-06-09,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"waitstaff was excellent but the fried clams were tiny,dried out and too salty for my taste
others raved about the clam chowder butoverall for a seafood restaurant where there are so many otheroptions not worth the price. try the clam box on the north shore instead"

2017-05-19,EileenM,4.0,"clam chowder or the appetizer crab cake and side salad is a perfect light dinner. we always love the delicious rolls. the restaurant was very crowded and very, very noisy and there  people stacked up at the front desk. the staff patiently served everyone in turn. sure was glad i had a reservation! i think we came in at the peak of the rush on a friday night on graduation weekend."

2017-05-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,service is always top notch. great comfortable dining room. food was good but not the quality level we have come to expect.
2017-05-06,Rose,2.0,"legal seafood is typically good for it's consistency; not so much their creativity. the food was on par with what you'd expect... solid clam chowder, salads, calamari, etc. this day wasn't any different. however, despite it being relatively quiet on this rainy saturday at lunch, service was extremely slow. we had to check in a few times on status of our food. there were complaints from members of our party about way too much honey mustard sauce on the crab cake salad. it was sort of drowning in it. i also felt that the overall cleanliness of this location was not great. without going into the details, i'll just leave that the women's bathroom needed some serious attention. it just seemed that either this location is not quite at the level of others or perhaps we had the b-team running the show on this day."
2017-05-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"lobster wasn't fresh hard to crack shell rubbery.  all other food was good.  service a bit slow but overall attentive.  too many little kids who were not well behaved, tisk risk to the parents of these unruly children."

2017-04-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the fried shrimp  went down to 7 shrimp from initially 12 to 10 and thud time down to 7,  this is an insufficient number for a dinner .  i would rather spend a little more than  leave hungry."
2017-04-09,Rick,3.0,"my wife and i waited 15 minutes before a waiter paid any attention to us, and 45 minutes after being seated we finally got our food. apparently the level of service in this restaurant has deteriorated."

2017-04-02,BenM,2.0,"took an hour for the food - waiter served something that was left under a heat lamp for 20 minutes - the manager, kevin, took care of the situation and made it ""right"".  because of kevin we will come back - thanks kevin"
2017-04-02,kurt,1.0,"been eating at legal for more than 30 years. fried clams served burned and cold.  clearly the oil was way too hot.  worst meal ever at legal. i should have sent the food back( my fault). but, the food never should have been served in the first place.   

at legal you pay a premium for quality.......but

(at the end the waiter asked me how my meal was. i told him the truth. he said sorry and walked away  ).   not sure why the waiter would not say ' would you like to talk to the manager?'

still kicking myself......."
2017-03-31,Liketoeatout,4.0,legal is always a good meal and reliable. i think the prices have gotten outrageously high recently!

the chowders are great too."
2017-03-25,OpenTable Diner,3.0,we come here at least once a month but the food for some reason wasn't as great as it was before. my wife said the same thing when i asked her. i got the fisherman platter and she had the seafood casserole. maybe just an off night.
2017-03-25,Alysia,5.0,"food was fantastic and while pricier than most places i dine, the quality is definitely worth the cost. service was excellent as well."
2017-03-24,ski4food,3.0,"had a decent meal, but was very disappointed with my cocktail... order bullit rocks and the bullit was extremely watered down... for the amount they charge for the drink, it should not be watered down.   i know when it's straight and when it's watered and this was close to a 2:1 bullit to water mix... very disappointed"
2017-03-24,LTNahant,5.0,fabulous meal with an awesome waitress!!! family dinner out made special!!
2017-03-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"i made a reservation for a one year anniversary because the last time i went, the seafood was phenomenal! 
so some restaurants still have you wait even when you have a reservation, we were able to immediately sit both times. our waiters name was carlos, extremely nice guy, very knowledgeable, gave us specials and what he prefers on different meal choices and even wines. 
we started with calimari and lobster bisque. both great app's and some places don't put big chunks or any at all. bisque from here had sizeable chunks of lobster. price wasn't bad either. 
main course i had the chopinnio, essentially a seafood tasting of everything including lobster with a bed of pasta and light red sauce. absolutely outstanding for the price. my better half had a steamed lobster with fried onion strands or thin onion rings to relate, then steamed broccoli. some places the lobster meat is not even there, but these were completely full from tail to claw. pretty sure it was 1-1.5lbs of lobster meat from what they said on the menu. again great value for what you get! 
for dessert we got the key lime pie with a side of whipped cream that was topped with pomegranate juice. make sure you aren't full if you want that, it was dense, we had a hard time lol. 
carlos made it really one of a kind. he advised me on chopinnio on the bed instead of on the side, i already knew that but most waiters could care less. i asked what type of wine would go best and he went on a full tangent on their wine selection, chalk full of info, another plus. on top of that he checked on us frequently and even got the dessert on the house with lit candles and sung happy anniversary in the form of happy birthday. i'm telling you this guy was top notch and authentic. 
overall your visit here will be of rememberance for any occasion, food and wine were tasteful and every dollar is well spent for what you get."
2017-03-23,HappytodineatLSF,4.0,"excellent service- both server and manager were highly knowledgeable of dietary restrictions and went out of their way to accommodate our party. meals were very good and atmosphere was lively but unhurried. we thoroughly enjoyed our experience-----as we always do! 
 we did think that our server this time was extra special!!!  and  we appreciated the attention paid by the manager- who delivered the meals that were gf. 
and since this was a special get together with our niece who was visiting on business- we so appreciated the unrushed atmosphere. we also love being able to request a booth for quieter conversation. really great that legal seafood's honors these special requests!!
as always, we will be back and highly recommend legal seafood's !"
2017-03-23,MarionL,5.0,"the garlic shrimp was one of the best dishes i've had in a long time.   followed up with the bonbon dessert, an espresso martini, and excellent service, i can make an unqualified 5-star recommendation for this restaurant."

2017-03-18,StephenW,3.0,"i had not been to legal seafoods in about 4 years, the service was excellent the wait staff was professional and fun however overall my guests and i were dissapionted. the quality of the food was nothing special and very much over priced. for 3 people we spent over $200 and i do not feel the portion size nor the quality was worth the cost."
2017-03-18,Claire,3.0,service was wonderful.
2017-03-17,TripAdvisor,5.0,"loved my dinner here tonight.  started with the perfect shrimp cocktail... legal has perhaps my favorite one, perfect shrimp and sauce to match.  my simple steamed lobster, about 2 lbs, was fantastic... tender, so flavorful... one of the best i've had here.  served with good, not great sides.. mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  sonoma cutrer chardonnay rounded out the meal. service from arthur was excellent, a real pro who i will request next time i'm in... does everything right."

2017-03-12,dinerdiva,4.0,pricey...smaller portions than expected but the swordfish was very good
2017-03-12,CathyB,5.0,"legal seafoods never disappoints.  the food is always of impeccable quality; the seafood is so fresh. i ordered grilled scallops with sides of spinach and cole slaw, but snuck a few tastes of my husband's french fries.  all were delicious! and the fresh-baked rolls are sublime and just the right size.  we had a family dinner to celebrate two birthdays, and our server brought us chocolate-covered ice cream bonbons with candles.  a great experience."
2017-03-11,Alan,5.0,"best seafood around. had cioppino which is absolutely loaded with muscles, clams, squid, scallops, shrimp, fish and lobster claw. i get cioppino in many restaurants and this is best by far. we also had norwegian special fish (similar to cod) which was delicious and prepared perfectly.  bottom line is legal seafood at framingham is the best seafood restaurant and a can't miss dining experience"

that said, food was excellent, waitress was warm and friendly and efficient and the food is something i look forward to when i return back to massachusetts.  always consistent and delicious!"
2017-03-11,Delegator,3.0,"i have been to several legal sea foods locations over the past 30 years, so i knew what to expect. the food was good (somewhat expensive though). i will say that this location was noisier than most. other than that, typical of the brand."
2017-03-10,JennN,4.0,"enjoyed out recent night out a legal's.  met some friends for dinner.  table was ready within 5 min of reservation time.  original table was a little small, but wait staff was very accommodating when we asked to move to a larger table (one opened up right next to us).   food was yummy - so happy to get some good oysters!  my husband and i just ordered a variety of appetizers, the other couple both ordered meals.  all were happy with the food (tuna sashimi was especially good - and a tad spicy, which i liked!).  my one complaint was that some of our drinks were slow to come out, but again, wait staff was excellent, taking the dessert off the bill in compensation without any prompting from us.  we always enjoy an evening at legals!"
2017-03-09,MaryD,3.0,"everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal, my skrie (white fish) was overcooked and had to be cut with a knife which was unfortunate. everything else was good."
2017-03-09,Hungry1,5.0,"terrific service from omar!  fine cocktails, delicious entrees, and a very special round booth.  two memorable dishes are the fried clams and the grilled trout."
2017-03-08,marjo,4.0,"had dinner at legal again, and again it was a very good experience. we ordered appetizers of oysters legal (that were much better than a lot of more expensive steak restaurants that call them by other names) and a small green salad. only slight problem, we were sipping our wine and had to notify the waiter that our appetizers were late in coming. he checked the kitchen, found the ""problem"" and they were delivered. main courses of salmon special and cioppino were excellent with our second glasses of wine. we were very satisfied with our experience at legal again.
oh, almost forgot, because our appetizers were ""so late"" manager gave us a portion of shrimp cocktail to share while waiting for our main course. and he said the appetizers were free!!
wow, can't wait to go back!"
2017-03-08,YSKim,5.0,"dining out with my sister-in-law, nephew and niece-in-law at my favorite restaurant (legal sea foods in framingham) was very enjoyable.  sonya, who is my favorite restaurant staff in the whole wide world, was attentive to detail, friendly, and professional.  i knew sonya was going to be great, however, she exceeded my expectations.  managers in charge (kevin and lisa) and several members of the restaurant team came over to our table to greet us.  all of them made my family feel very special and welcome.  my special thanks go to sonya and kevin for serving us two desserts free of charge, which was totally unexpected.  i feel honored and privileged to have such an attentive, friendly and professional group of hard working people in my life.  your service exceeds my expectations time after time and i strive to be such a server like you.  many thanks to all of you from a very grateful customer!

2017-03-06,Ballou,4.0,"we love legal-especially framingham. my wife got her favorite-lunch scallops. great as always. my meal wasn't quite what i hoped. i ordered the grilled salmon special served over shrimp risotto with olive oil. the salmon was great-cooked to perfection. however, the shrimp risotto was bland and ""swimming "" in too much olive oil. the olive oil taste was flat - more like cooking olive oil than quality evoo.  it was a bit pricey at $29. we will be back-just won't order this salmon special again."
2017-03-06,Fisco,4.0,"legal seafood is a chain, they provide the best crab cake on the planet, and possibly the best clam chowder. the rest is nice, but not extraordinary. the oysters selection vary with market and is often decent but perhaps a bit pricey. you can have several side orders with your meal to choose from. the cocktail are well made and for lunch it is quiet. service is always excellent at this location."
2017-03-05,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great service
2017-03-04,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"i am mixed on this review...the service was really great from the moment we stepped inside to when we walked out every employee took a moment to say hello or offered assistance. the waitstaff helped each other with clearing tables and bring out food. now the neg, the food was just ok for it being legal seafoods and growing up in boston i was really hoping for greatness. the mussels came out 3-4 minutes after we ordered them and they were on the cold side with toast that would break a window. the surf and turf, the filet was amazing and cooked perfect for both of us but the lobster was way over cooked and very chewy. the sides, mashed potato was good not great and the jasmine rice was cold but the mushrooms were very very good. so overall order simple easy food and enjoy the attentive staff."
2017-03-04,LTNahant,5.0,our meal was terrific. service was excellent. great all around meal.

2017-02-25,ChristineB,5.0,our waiter was excellent. we had one person with walker and i had forgotten to ask for handicap access but we came in using a ramp w/o having to ask. one guest had been to same restaurant a few weeks earlier and he remarked that our seating was in a much better place for noise control from
2017-02-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the food was great and the service was above and beyond excellent.  we had a party of 7 (including 2 kids) and our table was ready on time for our reservation.
2017-02-25,Mindy,3.0,"appetizer was nice but the meals which were mostly fish were very stale, might need to supervise the chef more, certainly we can make a salmon with not much effort better than that. one side was grilled the other side wasn't prepared at all, i love sushi but this was not prepared by any measure. i know fish pretty well, the fish was nice but the cook didn't do it justice"
2017-02-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"are at the bar and service and drinks were excellent.  food was good quality, crowd was on the older side - if it matters to you."

that said in 10 visits this was my first disappointment."
2017-02-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,celebrating a friend's birthday...loved the curved booth seating...food great...service great...never felt rushed to get out...everyone enjoyed it

2017-02-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"i made reservations for a business lunch meeting, and requested a quiet area.  
without having to ask in person, they seated us in a perfect location.  
the seafood was fresh, and the service was outstanding.  
legal sea food is always a consistently great dining experience."
2017-02-15,RichD,4.0,"all around good experience with reservation, wine, selection, appetizers, entrees and service. grilled salmon was overcooked and dry. we were comped for dessert. did not expect that...super nice gesture and certainly looking forward to dining there again."
2017-02-15,Dennis,5.0,"took my wife to legal for valentine's day.  great crabcakes, scallops, shrimp, polenta, boston crème pie.  hot waiter !!"

2017-02-14,out2dine,5.0,"this was the best meal we've enjoyed at legals seafood in framingham. everything was top notch!  our waiter sean m was excellent, as well as the wait staff and manager.  we created our own clam bake and enjoyed the clam chowder, steamers and lobster.  we tried the rum swizzle drinks which were very good. the waiter made sure the meal was paced and didn't rush.  the manager apologized that we had to wait a little bit longer than usual for the lobster. the meal was delicious and well worth the price. we'll look forward to returning again.  thanks for an enjoyable meal!"
2017-02-13,YSKim,5.0,"we were on a time crunch, however, our server was able to accommodate our need.  as always, the food was prepared well...our salad was fresh, cold and tasty and steamers were hot and delicious.  the staff and server were friendly, courteous and professional."
2017-02-12,Lynne,4.0,"we always enjoy the food; fresh and delicious.  we were seated by a pay station with dustpan, broom and stacked booster seats in view.  we asked for a table change and were quickly offered another table nearby.  service was fine."
2017-02-11,JimH,4.0,reservation are a must-have in the evening but the foods and service are reliably good and they were on this visit.
2017-02-11,Taino,5.0,best seafood in boston! best chioppino ever !! love the raw oysters and would trust only legal seafood for any raw shellfish.
2017-02-11,Alan,3.0,both of us had the special baked stuffed lobster with lobster and king crab stuffing.  same price as baked stuffed lobster with shrimp and scallops stuffing (which is always excellent and full of both).  both lobsters were on smaller side of 1.25-1.5 range. usually size in towards top of range.  however lobster came out with no claws so they just put claw meat into stuffing and were very light on the crab. i didnt have 2 claws of meat int the stuffing and my wife didn't have any crab meat.  i really like legal seafood and we go there a lot but was definitely disappointed in this meal.  stick with the normal stuffing for the baked stuff lobster
2017-02-10,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"i think it,s the best restaurant in framingham...  always fresh,  service is 100%.  something for everyone.  specials are all good.  nothing to complain about."
2017-02-08,Mike,4.0,food was very good and prepared just right.  a good experience.
2017-02-08,OpenTable Diner,5.0,lovely lunch... fresh fabulous food... our waiter was fantastic.   i think his name was omar...great menu.
2017-02-06,srbeau,3.0,"i have eaten at legal seafood at many locations for several years and have always had very good food, until this time.  i had the baked stuffed shrimp with crabmeat stuffing.  the dish had been under the broiler too long - the tips of the stuffing were black and tasted burned.  there was far too much breading vs crabmeat in the stuffing.  and there were only four shrimp, which was fine for my appetite level but not fine for the $28 price.  the other meal had a side of a baked potato that was so old, you couldn't get the regular knife to cut it.  inside, the potato so unappetizing - glue like and stuck to the thick shell.  this meal was definitely not up to legal seafood standards.  i do have to say our waiter was excellent as usual."
2017-02-05,Luvsav,4.0,"my husband and i both had the crab cake dinner. we have ordered this dish at least 20 other times. this time it was just not the same. it actually felt like it had more filler than ever. it usually is just lump crabmeat with very little anything else. it was a darker color and was also on the spicy side. the side salad was delicious as was the sautéed spinach. husband had the soup and said it was the best yet. 
will defiantly return, but not sure about ordering the crab cake again."
2017-02-05,Elena,5.0,"ali, our server was the best"
2017-02-05,ArnetteM,5.0,excellent dinner!
2017-02-02,RobertC,5.0,"legal sea foods in framingham, ma is consistently excellent!  thanks for the great food and great service.  everything was perfect!"
2017-02-02,sjlfood,5.0,still the best for seafood
2017-02-01,ChowderHead,4.0,"how can i appear to be critical of a restaurant chain that i've probably dined at over 200 times in 20 years?  because i want it and all the legal restaurants to stay true to their heritage -- excellent seafood, simply but expertly prepared, served when ready, and good value.  legal's still delivers on most of its promises, but the value proposition has changed.  we went from shrinking portion sizes to what seem to be a series of price increases, along with an increase in portion size!  is that why you can always get a seat at the bar in the framingham location now?  the buzz of diners waiting for a table seems to have diminished a bit, and i don't think that's because of new entrants, like the bonefish grille and the new island creek oyster bar in burlington.

the framingham location is still my favorite for casual dining (only the old hole-in-the-wall location next to the park plaza was better).  and the newish flagship location in the seaport is spectacular for special occasions.  i'll probably never stop going to the framingham location (i'll be there for lunch on saturday), but legal's is no longer the exclusive fish restaurant in my dining repertoire."
2017-01-31,VickiT,5.0,we have been dining at legal's since 1979 and have never been disappointed. the high quality of their fish cannot be matched.
2017-01-31,Cynthia,4.0,"seafood. casserole very good but back up on the bread crumbs, a little too heavy!
fish and chips, great flavor, strings a favorite but ""chips"" filled the plate ... way too many, my plate was covered! fish crispy and yummy!
thank you."
2017-01-30,Margie,3.0,"very slow service today and restaurant was not busy. 
noticed that portion size of lunch entrees has decreased. disappointing."
2017-01-29,Dizz,1.0,"our food was cold even though they took dishes and heated them up.  service was fine, but only 1-2 people of the 12 enjoyed their meals.  food was way overpriced for what it was.  bland.  kids meals - mac and cheese and chicken were terrible.  not pleased at all.  we do not mind paying if it is worth it.  will not return.

legal seafoods at assembly square is  much better value."
2017-01-28,OpenTable Diner,3.0,food ok but high price.  service was great!
2017-01-27,marcia,4.0,my meal was very good but the portion was very small for the price.
2017-01-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,good seafood!
2017-01-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,our server was on point and probably the best i have ever had . food was great ! we will be back for sure .
2017-01-22,Rapunzel,2.0,"i have food allergies, and always choose to dine at legal's for their attention to detail.  this past visit, i became extremely ill after our dinner.  i was very disappointed as i trusted the kitchen to be extra careful with my food.  somehow, something was overlooked, and i suffered the consequences.  i think we will be taking a break from dining at legal's for a while."
2017-01-21,gantetsu,4.0,service was a bit spotty. took a few requests to get a cup of coffee refilled. one order was missing a side.
2017-01-20,Used2LikeBENIHANA,1.0,service was very poor!
2017-01-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great service, great food, equals a great evening for my wife on her birthday."
2017-01-16,Underwhelming,4.0,"the thai calamari was absolutely amazing and the grilled shrimp were abundant and perfectly cooked. our waiter could not have been nicer or more attentive. kudos to legal for it's outstanding service. everything was served at a nice pace and we weren't rushed. 
the room at the back was nice and quieter than the bar in the front. 
legal never disappoints."
2017-01-16,Lovestoeatout2,3.0,"fried haddock was slightly over cooked and very pricey -$26 - served with cole slaw, fries, tartar sauce, rolls, butter. for this price i expected perfection in cooking."
2017-01-16,Bestfive,5.0,consistently excellent food and service. we had a very good server who went above and beyond.
2017-01-15,CatieF,5.0,"stopped by for dinner after a show in wellesley and we were seated immediately.  server was prompt, cheerful and charming.  my husband had the tuna steak and i had the seafood casserole.  both were excellent!  environment is bustling, but have yet to be disappointed.  always enjoy dining at legal seafoods!"
2017-01-14,fech,5.0,"everything was perfect. we were having a girls luncheon.   the food was  delicious, we cleaned our plate!  the service outstanding, kind, friendly and professional and the restaurant was clean and filled with happy guests."

2017-01-13,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"our waitress was excellent!  and a fine experience except for being put in the back room with two large parties.  not the same ambience as being in the dining room, so a bit disappointing ..."
2017-01-13,Ballou,5.0,always special. i had the faroe island salmon with mushroom ravioli-my wife had the luncheon scallops with mashed and cheese broccoli.  the boston cream  pie was really special.
2017-01-09,Qban,4.0,"the place is nice, the service was exceptional, and the food very good, but it is an expensive place."
2017-01-08,TripAdvisor,4.0,another fine meal here.  had a great lobster w/choice of sides.  started with the fantastic clam chowder.   chardonnay from sonoma cutrer rounded it out.  very good service from dan.
2017-01-06,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"it was loud, food was very expensive, tasted fair .
would look for another resturant next time"
2017-01-06,jeannines,2.0,legal seafood just ain't what it used to be. the tried and true stuff on the menu is your best bet as tired as it is. attempts to update the menu just haven't panned out. no pun intended. ok maybe it was. legal's spin off restaurants like the c bar and ltk are much better dining experiences. the original is just too big and the quality of the food has really become mediocre. still lots of people go there and it's always crowded so apparently lots of people don't mind average. my opinion - stay home and cook.
2017-01-05,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"legal seafood has always been a good place to go for seafood. in recent years,on prior occasions the service has not been very experienced, but this time the waiter was very good. he showed up just frequently enough, gave good suggestions, had a cocktail menu on hand and timed the drinks and food appropriately. the food is fresh and tasty although we notice that the non premium house side dishes available to choose are predominantly starches. it would be good to have more green vegetables available for these house choices."
2017-01-05,RobertL,5.0,great food to loud
2017-01-04,juju2016,5.0,legal's never disappoints. i had a delicious mixed seafood grill plate and was able to make some substitutes on to accommodate my diet. delicious!
2017-01-02,YSKim,5.0,"as always, the staff was professional, cordial and knowledgeable.  the food was cooked as requested and served promptly.  my guests and i had a wonderful dining experience."
2017-01-01,PastryChef,3.0,"i have been a frequent dinner at your framingham location. i always request omar as our serve, if he's is working. the last few visit the meals have been less that good. lacking freshness and taste.
christmas eve 12/24/16,  i order tuna, one of my favorites. it had very little taste. i grew up on the cape eating tuna. i always ordered it at legal, because the taste and quality was excellent. 
i was suprised at how old and tasteless my tuna was.

we returned on new years day 01/01/17, i ordered my 2nd favorite grilled hadock. it also was old and tasteless.  i am not sure what is going on at this location. also, the rest room was dirty, no papertowels, missing paper toilet seat covers in 4 stalls, one soap dispenser was empty and paper, trash all over the floor. i have never seen legal seafood like this.

i am sad to see one of my favourite restaurants go bad."
2017-01-01,OpenTable Diner,1.0,this was not legals best day.  i dined with my mom and sister on new years.  the server was new nad acknowledged as much.  i had dry crab cakes and over cooked shrimp.  my sister had a dish with three kinds of fish scallops which she really liked. turned out they did not have vanilla ice cream so i couldn't get the banana foster and ended up with an unexciting slice of cheese cake that was supposed to have peppermint sprinkles. my sister ordered key lime pie which came warm and runny.  not good.  she did get a replacement dish.
2017-01-01,OpenTable Diner,4.0,food is always good just took a little too long to come out. other than that the staff is always friendly!
2017-01-01,Alan,4.0,"always excellent food. shrimp and scallop stuffing is a must when getting lobster. cioppino is full of seafood and best around. bread with cioppino was very stale, hard and not edible."
2016-12-31,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the food and service were outstanding. great place to meet and get together for drinks and/or dinner with friends.
2016-12-31,StatLady,5.0,annual event to have new years eve lunch at framingham legal sea foods. excellent and always festive!
2016-12-31,KVNF,5.0,"it was a great dinner with great service and great food, its definitely a fantastic place to go for a special lunch with friends and or family or when you have the money to treat yourself. it can be loud and crowded at peak times and some seating locations can be rather tight but that's to be expected with the limitations of the building and set up of the seating. overall i hope to come back at my earliest possible date for more delectable seafood."
2016-12-30,Rose,5.0,"great service, meal was perfect! great evening."
2016-12-30,Julesres,4.0,"when you first go in it feels a little dated and needing go an update.  also not a real fresh smell, needs a good cleaning probably due to all the frying they are doing and cooking of fish.  the meal was good, but not the best i have had, i would say average.  they are creative with some of the dishes.  drinks were creative"
2016-12-30,ChristinG,5.0,high quality food . great for diners with food allergies. excellent service!

2016-12-27,Denbrook,5.0,celebrated our 54th anniversary and had a fine meal. preordered flowers were on our table when we sat down. servers were excellent and we did not feel at all rushed although the restaurant was quite busy. we have eaten there a number of times and never been disappointed.
2016-12-26,BKL1982,2.0,this is usually our favorite restaurant so we got a gift cert from our daughter.  this night was an off night.  drinks were served mid meal as were salads.  scallops were not as good as usual.  we will go back but this was a disappointing meal.
2016-12-26,TParB,4.0,table of four.  reliable and very well prepared fish as usual.  service was slow but that was okay just then because we weren't in a hurry.  but initial drinks took far too long.  legal's is higher proceed but the quality is worth it.
2016-12-26,EinFalmouth,4.0,food and server were excellent. hostess was snippy when we asked how much longer the wait was even with a reservation.
2016-12-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had a lovely family christmas dinner. all of the staff were wonderful. our waiter even heated water for our baby granddaughter's bottle ! we love legal seafoods and haven't been disappointed in over twenty years. thanks for being open on christmas!
2016-12-25,FrancesG,5.0,"we had dinner at legal sea foods on christmas day. it was packed so i was very glad i'd made a reservation. the food was excellent - we had the seafood casserole and salmon rice bowl, which left room for the maple bread pudding which was amazing. if i had one suggestion it would be that they offered more wines by the glass in the moderate price range. overall it was a great experience."
2016-12-25,atticus24,4.0,legal's on christmas day...steamers were amazing !  great meal.  great service!
2016-12-25,Betsy,4.0,"legal offers fresh fish nicely prepared. our party had a variety:  grilled swordfish, grilled scallops, baked cod and baked stuffed shrimp (stuffed mostly with crab).  all were prepared nicely and portions were substantial.  a variety of sides were offered -  we opted for rice, potation, onion strings and salads.   our server was knowledgable and kept the meal pace just perfect.  we chose the key lime pie and the day's dessert special - maple bread pudding.  both were delicious.  
the room was nicely furnished and quiet enough for normal conversation.
if it's fish you're looking for - then legal is an excellent choice."
2016-12-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,every employee from our server to the hostess was friendly and helpful.  we were there for lunch with family and it was wonderful.

2016-12-25,Peetie,5.0,the 3rd xmas eve that we have chosen to go and we thoroughly enjoyed it. i started with the very tasty bang-bang cauliflower and had excellent swordfish! my wife had two lump crab cakes that were excellent. our servers were very attentive even though the restaurant was very busy. it was a lovely way to start xmas.
2016-12-24,DeborahK,2.0,"didn't have anything unique about the meal, sides were not interesting, will not go again.  had stuffed shrimp in casserole which was dry, no flavor.  surf and turf was ok.......felt like a chain restaurant, nothing special."
2016-12-24,GeoH,1.0,"was having a very nice christmas eve dinner with the family until my entree, the seafood casserole was served.  had a few bites and noticed it tasted a little off then the ammonia smell hit me.  really turned my stomach.  ruined what would have been a great night out.  my entree was taken off the bill and the manager apologized but that was about it."
2016-12-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"my family and i dined at legals to celebrate christmas eve as a family.  we were apparently not the only ones with this idea.  there were quite a few families with very young children who had the same idea.  my sister and i had the seafood combo which provided generous portions of shrimp, scallops, swordfish, tuna, and salmon together with your choice of two sides (we both chose a baked potato huge and steamed broccoli).  mother enjoyed the fish and chips.  while we waited we enjoyed a nice piping hot dinner roll and coffee.  our meals were well seasoned and cooked though i found the swordfish overcooked and rubbery.  afterwards mother enjoyed coffee while my sister and i had dessert.  i enjoyed the maple bread pudding and my sister enjoyed her perennial favorite the key lime pie.  our server was wonderful patient, solicitous, and prompt in providing service.  overall, we had a wonderful dinner and i highly recommend legals if you have a special occasion planned, you won't be sorry."
2016-12-24,Retiredteacher,4.0,"always an excellent dining choice.  great seafood, excellent service and yummy desserts.  not a quiet place but you can have conversation with your table mates."

2016-12-20,smithie65,5.0,"delicious food, beautifully prepared and presented. entire staff very welcoming and accommodating to special requests for seating, food preparation.  in particular, our  waiter, nathan was one of the best waiters we have ever had. wonderful food and outstanding service made for one of the  nicest evenings we have had in a long time. we will be back!"
2016-12-19,Mike,4.0,"food was fair at best and very expensive, but i do keep coming back."
2016-12-19,Erin,5.0,we had a great dining experience. the oysters and crab cake appetizers were delicious and the bay scallop entree was great. excellent service was the icing on the cake.
2016-12-19,eecm,5.0,excellent seafood and atmosphere. cannot go wrong with any of the menu options
2016-12-18,CindyG,5.0,"we had a wonderful meal. starting with the chowder and caesar salad, which were fabulous, and ending with two perfectly cooked entrées, the grilled swordfish and baked scallops. it was pricey but worth it. our waiter was charming and funny and never missed a beat."
2016-12-16,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"i have been going to legsl seafood for forty years and love it. i've been to most locations in massachusetts including the airports.  i have had several large group dinners ther as well. clearly i love their food. 

now my wife and i go to framingham about every six weeks. for the first time ever i had a bad experience.  the waitress at the bar was in such a bad mood and was terse with us. when we complained the bartenders just avoided us. they stopped serving us drinks even though we had each only had two drinks.   we spent over 300 bucks and left feeling lousy. even so we still have a 15% tip"
2016-12-14,Robbie,4.0,"reservation on time.  excellent service.  very good food, and cocktails, with a nice quiet atmosphere.  legals remains the best seafood restaurant in the boston area, and continues to be one of my favorites.

2016-12-13,SoleFan,4.0,"our waitress, janet n. was outstanding. a bit loud at times but very pleased with entrees and starters."
2016-12-13,Sammie,4.0,meals were excellent as usual.....love that!  staff was slightly less on the mark but still more than acceptable - perhaps just an off night for our server. this would never deter us from returning as our many experiences have been so positive with both food and service.
2016-12-10,theaterlover,5.0,reliably delicious seafood in a nice atmosphere.  make sure you're hungry when you go.
2016-12-10,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"this is our 3rd year in a row that we have met 7 friends there for our annual christmas luncheon.  had a great meal, waiter was very good and overall had a wonderful experience.  we will be there next year!"
2016-12-10,Kayla,5.0,"visit was exception from start to finish. drinks were delicious, ordered an apple sangria and a white sangria. ordered seafood casserole and crab cake lunch meals and both were great. service was excellent as well."
2016-12-09,YSKim,5.0,"my guest and i thoroughly enjoyed the lunch at the legal sea foods in framingham, which is my favorite restaurant.  staff members were friendly, courteous and professional and our meal was served at the right pace."
2016-12-08,Joan,5.0,"always good.  always consistent.  excellent crab cakes.  good wine list.  if you want seafood in the framingham area, this is the place to go.  i bring my work associates from land locked cities to this restaurant.  they are always happy."
2016-12-08,TripAdvisor,4.0,"enjoyed another fine dinner here. started with their good rolls, served warm. shrimp cocktail, perfect. enjoyed the bay scallops that were featured... good sides. service was friendly and efficient. excellent pumpkin cheesecake was a special... we shared, a few bites was a perfect ending."
2016-12-08,Ballou,5.0,one of the best values on the lunch menu is the cod fish sandwich. comes with two complimentary sides. the seasonal special side is squash and cranberry- delicious ! it's always special when judy is your server!
2016-12-08,Gonzo,4.0,"legal seafoods is a great place to have a drink and have a quick meal. i used to come here a lot to lunch and dinner, but i feel that the menu has been stale for too many years and there are not new innovations for me to want to come back.

having said that, this is one of the best places for fish and if this is your first time, you will be amazed how fresh and delicious the food is here.

for us, it is more about having a good time now, sharing a drink than really choosing this place to eat"
2016-12-07,YSKim,5.0,"as always, i enjoyed the friendly staff, delicious meal and prompt service.  my guest also enjoyed her dining experience at legal sea foods in framingham."
2016-12-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great food, great service. the lobster bisque soup was outstanding and all meals (x5 people) were rated very high across the board."
2016-12-04,CityAtNight,3.0,"i think we can clearly say that legals is now just another mediocre chain. 
i used to really enjoy legals and liked their stance about not being a chain and ""if it's fresh, it is legal"" was a great message. i don't think that is who they are anymore."
2016-12-04,Malloy,5.0,"delicious, fresh seafood wonderfully prepared.  they have the best clam chowder around.  i would go more often if i lived closer.  i will be back soon.  i also love the modern feel and great service here."
2016-12-03,Tommyzaz,3.0,the food and service were amazing but the noise level was off the charts. we were yelling to each other just to conduct a conversation.
2016-12-03,James,4.0,quality of food is always very good but horribly over priced for underwhelming portion sizes.
2016-12-02,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent service, substantial servings of delicious fresh seafood. a bit pricey but enough leftovers for a second meal the next day. highly recommend."
2016-12-02,Ballou,5.0,arthur was one of the most professional waiter we have ever experienced. lunch shrimp and scallops were terrific!

2016-11-30,Todd,2.0,some of the worst swordfish i have ever tasted.  must have been frozen for a decade.  restaurant needs a makeover.

2016-11-27,MartinQ,5.0,"each of us had the mixed grill - very generous and well prepared. squash and spinach sides were also fine, as was the bottle of reasonably priced grenache. the waitress was as good as one could ever be. a lovely dining experience."
2016-11-27,thred,5.0,"we have been going to the framingham restaurant since it opened
we like it a lot"
2016-11-27,Elena,5.0,best server ever!
2016-11-27,Rarphantom,4.0,"typical legal. soups were good, but the salads were horrible and went back. the fried fisherman's platter was over cooked and dried out and the clams were tough.  very pricey for the subpar quality. kevin was awesome in handling the matter, but still expect a lot more quality for $100 a couple!"
2016-11-25,Arnie,5.0,seated us as soon as we arrived. our server was very efficient and attentive ! all requests were granted!
2016-11-24,dinnerwithdad,5.0,my family went for thanksgiving and had a wonderful meal together.  nobody had the turkey so i can't comment on that but we all enjoyed our fish and seafood very much.  and of course had to have the great banana foster for dessert.
2016-11-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the seafood dishes were excellent, the staff were friendly, the service was efficient and timely. they provided good value and i would strongly recommend the restaurant to others."
2016-11-24,Teach212,5.0,"spent thanksgiving dinner here with friends.  none of us are ""turkey fans"" so the legal menu was perfect for us.  of course, we did have to enjoy the pumpkin cheesecake as our way to respect holiday tradition."
2016-11-24,Chrissy,5.0,"three of us went here for our thanksgiving meal. we asked for a booth when making the reservation, and mentioned that we were going to need 2 gluten free meals.  the service was excellent, from the woman who seated us, to the waitress, and to the manager who brought our gluten free meals.   we could not have had a better experience!  i would suggest making a reservation way ahead of the day you're going...this is a popular place.  a week ahead of time, the only times available for us were 11:00 am, 11:15am, and after 6:30 pm.  who would think a 
 seafood restaurant  would be so busy on thanksgiving?? food and atmosphere were excellent, and the noise level was low."
2016-11-20,RosangelaS,4.0,i usually get the nutty salmon and its always very good. last saturday i was a bit disappointed. spinach was cold and also the ravioli not as good as usually is.
2016-11-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent food, good value and outstanding customer service. that's why i dine there often!"
2016-11-19,Traveler,3.0,"new menu is ruining all the old standards... please don't mess with my steamer... they

2016-11-08,Megd,5.0,"once again the food was delicious.  the service was superb - our waitress, amber was fantastic!!!"
2016-11-06,Waylandmom,1.0,"we went for a birthday meal, but did not get even a verbal acknowledgement or a verbal happy birthday, let alone anything special.  the worst part is that we came in before 12:15, it was not until 12:30 before we got water poured into the glass.  the food came out close to 1:30, and when i told the waiter we were in a hurry (hello! already 75 minutes in), he acted surprised.  this was the worst experience i ever had in any legal seafood, and as a vip on open table, i have been to quite a few of them.  we had to ask for water several times and it was hard to even find wait staff because they were nowhere to be found most of time.  my quick observation is that every single table had to wait.  they were way-under staffed.  to say that i was disappointed was an understatement and i regret bitterly that i invited people for a birthday meal there. if you check my record on open table, this is the first time i ever wrote a negative review and i simply have nothing positive to say."
2016-11-06,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great food as always we had a good time our server was  great. overall good experience

2016-11-03,TripAdvisor,5.0,"another excellent meal here.  very reliable spot.  had the jasmine special tonight... shrimp, broccoli, rice with a cheese sauce and enjoyed it.  clam chowder always great.  crab cake... caesar, some vino rounded out our meal."
2016-11-02,vacation01,5.0,food was fantastic and it was a great menu with many interesting choices!
2016-11-01,Rapunzel,4.0,"our server, amanda, was fantastic.  it was my birthday, and she made sure that everything was perfect.  she even brought out a fruit plate with a candle for me because i have food allergies to the other desserts. my steak was very salty, and i was unable to finish it.  i brought it home and made it less salty.  other than that, we enjoyed everything about our evening."
2016-10-31,CeceD,5.0,"they were very accommodating when we were 20 minutes late for our reservation. the waitress was great, and the meals were delicious. we especially appreciate the extensive gluten-free offerings, including hot rolls! my hope is one day i'll be able to write the same for organic offerings. thanks for a nice birthday dinner out!"
2016-10-31,samb,4.0,"very happy with servor, serge and of course the detail s he put in to make the order right."
2016-10-30,Rarphantom,4.0,solid seafood experience which is good because this chain restaurant has slipped recently.   this time around service was great and so was the food. seafood casserole was great as was the clam chowder.
2016-10-30,ElizabethF,5.0,"i love legal's! it has yet to disappoint. the food is all amazing, wait staff is welcoming, and it is worth the price for a fancy night out!"

2016-10-28,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"menu was completely different, many of their traditional entrees seemed to be replaced with something different and more expensive."
2016-10-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,five of us in our party with and everyone had an delicious dinner. clam chowder was excellent.  our sever was exceptional.
2016-10-27,Ballou,5.0,"we got lucky when one of our favorite servers, judy, was available to take care of us. my wife had the luncheon scallops with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with cheese. i had the grilled shrimp with onion rings and cole slaw. we both had a terrific apple crisp desert topped with cinnamon ice cream. delicious! great place for anytime of the day."

2016-10-21,Food2diefor,5.0,all our food was delicious and presented beautifully. our waitstaff was attentive and treated us in a friendly manner but not intrusive.  had a nice booth in the back of the restaurant. good for conversation.
2016-10-21,Metaphilosopher,5.0,"we love coming to legal for special occasions - the prices are the upper edge of what we can spend on a semi-regular basis, but always worth the money.  any complaints we've had (and i can think of only one over the course of 5+ years) have been promptly addressed to our satisfaction.

the wait staff is always attentive, and the food is routinely excellent.

my one caveat is that this location can sometimes be a bit loud due to the architecture - hard wood tends to reflect sound nicely :)  we have no trouble carrying on a conversation, but i wouldn't take a phone call in there."
2016-10-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,my husband and i have been eating at legal for many years.  we like the food but especially like the service.
2016-10-18,Ballou,5.0,"great service as usual. i had the scallops, my wife had the salmon. dessert was wonderful with apple crisp! you should give it a try."
2016-10-17,JaneO,5.0,our server was most accommodating. once again we were allowed to have a leisurely lunch
2016-10-15,PeterS,5.0,"legal seafood is our most favorite restaurant in the area. we go all the time. framingham, dedham and boston. harbor side is our favorite but they are all wonderful. i would recommend to everyone."
2016-10-14,Koreander,4.0,"the food at legal's is always reliably consistent and delicious but nothing special.  the dishes are very straightforward.  the prices, though, have gotten crazy.  not sure that the value is there any longer."
2016-10-13,Snow,5.0,food was delicious and chad is a 5 star server!
2016-10-13,TripAdvisor,5.0,"when i want a satisfying meal in the area i think of legal. comfortable, good service, nice chow, good wine program. not everything is great, some are.

we enjoyed the best shrimp cocktail you'll find anywhere. the best clam chowder. crab cake is admirable. while i usually have halibut, lobster or crab legs, today decided to have the grilled chicken. was pretty good... basic but i liked it.

sonoma cutrer chard by the glass."
2016-10-10,ROBERTT,5.0,the legal sea foods on long island have all closed and  i took my daughter on a college road trip to ma and went to the one in framingham.  we already knew the food was excellent but we were both pleasantly surprised by a waiter named quincy who was so personable that it just made for a wonderful dining experience.  coming from ny it was unexpected and thought someone should know.  if she attends college in ma we will be sure to return to the framingham legal sea foods and often!
2016-10-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,excellent sea food as always. we brought our sister-in-law and her niece who were visiting from new mexico and wanted sea food. we got our niece a 2 - 2/12 pound steamed lobster and the rest of us had lobster casserole (not explicitly on the menu buy available nevertheless).  we began with 2 dozen oysters which were excellent also.
2016-10-09,Hello2334,5.0,"consistently great service and food. i especially appreciate how much care they show if you specify food allergies. you wait a little longer for your food, but it's worth the wait for them to take it seriously. we had the greek salad and cobb salad, where you can add a protein like crab, chicken or shrimp. we had crab and shrimp, which were delicious and impressive portion sizes. if you go for sunday brunch, you can't get alcohol until noon. it's like that everywhere in ma i believe. service was very friendly ... wish they came by a bit more to refill our water glasses though."
2016-10-08,wdnmb,5.0,"the food was delicious, and the table was in a location where even the hearing aid users were able to participate in the conversations. the server was also very  accommodating."
2016-10-08,Lovesfish,5.0,"our dinner was, as always, delish and wonderful !  our server, leo, was excellent - he just added that little extra care, interest and made the experience totally enjoyable - we loved it !"
2016-10-08,YSKim,5.0,"i invited my past buyer clients and their daughter to the dinner.  the food was well prepared, tasty and served timely.  the restaurant staff members were friendly, courteous and professional.  my guests and i had an enjoyable dining experience."
2016-10-07,Klink,4.0,"so glad we live nearby and could take our philly family here for dinner when they visited. our table was off to the side, the service was helpful and quick, and our guests were happy to enjoy lobster and other fresh fish. my salmon was delish with its mushroom raviolis on the side, and my nieces were delighted with their entrees, as well."
2016-10-05,LeslieN,4.0,"we always enjoy the food here, the service was fine and the manager checked to make sure we all had everything we wanted. a bit noisy though and not sure there is a quieter are there. 
but we will definitely go back for the food...."
2016-10-04,ChristinaP,2.0,"i took my boyfriend and my daughter here for both of there birthdays. our waitress seemed distracted, after getting our waters, finally came back 18 minutes later with our drinks. she forgot our bread, and when we were brought our appetizer (10 minutes after the drinks) a different waitress asked if we wanted bread. 
our portions were extremely small, and ranged about $30 a piece. my rice was very dry, and not very tasteful. 
my crab cake was very good and the shrimp, just the portion was very small. 
for 5 of us, and two ordering off the childrens menu, $185 dollars just seemed to be a bit too much.
i won't be returning."
2016-10-04,Megd,5.0,"our dinners are consistently delicious.  amber, our most recent waitress,  is exceptional with her warm smile and attentive manner!!!"
2016-10-03,Sammie,5.0,each of our four meals was prepared to perfection.  the drinks from the bar we prepared perfectly as well.  it was like coming home to a great memory.
2016-10-02,YSKim,5.0,"my business partner and i enjoyed their chopped greek salad, steamers, and bonbon.  judy was the server for our table.  she exceeded our expectations."
2016-10-02,AnneB,3.0,"first impressions were a bit disappointing. even though we'd booked a table for 8pm it was a further half an hour before we were shown to a table. i think we were added to the general waiting list and despite mentioning it to the person taking bookings, it didn't improve the wait time. the waiter was very attentive. i'd requested my tuna steak to be cooked medium-well and was very underdone. i think the meal was over-priced for the overall experience."
2016-10-01,Checkplease,4.0,had a guest in from out of town.  she really wanted to dine there.  the food is fine and the atmosphere was a bit loud.  she was dressed to the nines but there were folks in sweatshirts and ball caps.  for a saturday night it was a bit disappointing.
2016-10-01,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellant sea food and service. a little pricey. my only  criticism was the load noise which was pervasive and constant , making conversation strained. one should not have to shout to your dinner partner...the food and service par excellance, deserves a better ambiance."
2016-10-01,RichardS,5.0,i had the mixed seafood  grill and the fish was cooked  perfectly. my son had the mixed chilled seafood platter. enough  for 2. the freshness  of the seafood  is fantastic.
2016-09-30,Sketcher,5.0,"great fresh seafood as usual, we will continue to return hen we are in the mood for seafood and  nice atmosphere."
2016-09-29,Hudsontravelers,5.0,"we entertained someone from out of town who wanted new england seafood dinner. lobster bake was a combination of chowder, clams, mussels and lobster. he was in heaven.
the remainder of our party had a more traditional fish dinners.  portions were large so we each took half home. unfortunately our server gave us the other person's doggy bag. i was a little disappointed to not be able to have the rest of my delicious dinner."
2016-09-27,MrMrsSarasota,4.0,"we go to boston several times a year and usually go to one of the legal locations. this trip we went to the framingham location twice, once by ourselves, and once with friends. the food is always consistently good, but it seems that the portions get smaller.  i had the fried scallop dinner both times and wished for more scallops. my wife had fried clams on the first visit, which she loved, and haddock on the second visit, which she did not like because it was overcooked and dry. the clam chowder was very good. service was excellent both times."
2016-09-27,YSKim,5.0,"as usually, food and service were excellent.  i appreciate legal sea foods - framingham staff members, who are friendly, informative, cordial and professional."
2016-09-27,tfog,5.0,great dinner. i had the lobster bisque and the crab cake special.  awesome!
2016-09-24,rhrprice,3.0,"met friends for lunch. lovely ambience, food was good though very overpriced"
2016-09-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,took the family here for a special night out. my husbands halibut steak dish was good and my daughters fish sticks were very good also. i ordered the baked stuffed shrimp dish and the shrimp seemed to be over cooked and tough and the stuffing wasn't the best a bit soggy and not what i expected - wanted more of a buttery ritz cracker stuffing with the crab meat. the only crunchy part was the under cooked celery pieces. the service was good and atmosphere was acceptable and clean. i would give it a second chance and will go back
2016-09-23,Terry,4.0,"been going to legal since the late 60's and always had a good time, good food and good service. our waitress was outstanding."

2016-09-18,WCentral,4.0,fish very fresh and well prepared as usual.  baked potato came encrusted in salt--restaurant should leave such items to customer to salt to taste.
2016-09-18,YSKim,5.0,"as always, my business partner and i had a wonderful dining experience.  great food and professional staff!"
2016-09-17,SandraF,5.0,excellent as always...however miss some all time favorite like jelapano polenta and tortia and goat cheese salad....please put them back on the menu!

2016-09-17,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"clams were only strips, few bellies, paid for full clam.  overcooked,too few for the price.  very disappointing."
2016-09-16,michaelB,4.0,"legal is always consistent in quality i love the chiopino i get it all the time but the broth is always different and the seafood mix changes this time the sauce was  bright red very tomato like and there were only 2 little necks in it and 1 small piece of fish it had plenty of mussels , 4 scallops and 4 shrimp
thanks"
2016-09-16,TOM14369,5.0,i always get the crab cakes. very good and filling yet light.

2016-09-11,gacracker,4.0,"many gluten-free options, a major factor in selecting legal.  gluten-free seafood casserole was excellent;  grilled shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  portions were a bit big.  service was very attentive, professional, non-intrusive.  all staff we encountered were friendly, warm, welcoming."
2016-09-08,Ballou,5.0,"excellent service and meal. i had the dinner shrimp with onion rings and cole slaw. my wife enjoyed scallops with mashed and zucchini. we topped it off with bon-bons. 
legal in framingham is always a great choice for lunch or dinner. accepting open table is a big plus!"
2016-09-07,Mike,3.0,"food was average at best and is overpriced.  i had crab cakes, shrimp and scallops.  all were somewhat disappointing."
2016-09-07,Megd,5.0,our meals were delicious as usual!  an added treat was that crabmeat was available as a salad topping even though it wasn't on the dinner menu.  the waiter was extremely accommodating and attentive.
2016-09-04,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"extensive menu, superb food, great service. always dependable for a good meal and courteous service"
2016-09-04,BirdPark,2.0,it is quite unfortunate but the hostess was so rude and dismissive that it was difficult to enjoy any part of the experience. my family had their hearts set on particular items that we get as regulars and the oysters were a real draw for my husband. they begged to stay despite the hostess's attitude. i really can't come up with one excuse for her behavior. it's to bad she doesn't understand her role in the dining out experience.
2016-09-03,LoveSeafood,2.0,"food was greasy and very plain for the prices they charge, our waiter took forever because he was talking to a couple sitting behind us"
2016-08-31,Mike,4.0,we have been here many times and the quality of the food is always very good.  the waitstaff is   attentive. the restaurant is clean with no odors.  reservations are necessary or there could be a long wait.   i think the prices are high but it is a restaurant we go to for special occasions.
2016-08-31,YSKim,5.0,"as usual, legal sea foods, which is my favorite restaurant, delivered excellent food and our server, rachel, was professional, friendly and very attentive."
2016-08-31,Janet,5.0,"all outstanding:  service, decor, food quality & presentation. thank you!"
2016-08-29,Sammie,3.0,an off night for what is usually the most consistently excellent set of restaurants. food was not presented well and was not the fresh moist product we love.  we will return because this was such an anomaly- and we look forward to a repeat of our traditionally yummy seafood.
2016-08-28,Nance,5.0,the food is always fresh and perfectly cooked and prepared.  service is outstanding.  it is very comforting to know you can always get a consistently wonderful meal.
2016-08-27,KathyC,4.0,phenomenal food but noisy and in need of freshening up decor wise
2016-08-27,poochparents,5.0,"legals always delivers a delicious meal and dining experience.  from the oysters to the dessert, top notch.  tom our waiter was right on top of things too.  we love legals."
2016-08-27,SusanM,4.0,"we have enjoyed legal over the years.  we do feel though that it has gotten expensive.  on the positive side we were there on a saturday night and they were quite busy, but our waitress handled the service well."
2016-08-26,phyllisp,3.0,"it had to have been an off night as we regularly eat at a high top in the bar area. my cocktail was horrid (i've had a cosmo many times) and since nelson, our waiter, never came back, i went to find him. he did get me another drink. 
nelson was never around and whenever we found him, he had an excuse for not attending to us. the place was not full by any means! 
we will go back and attribute the bartender (who we were told was new) and nelson to an off night."
2016-08-26,LobsterLover,5.0,fabulous food!  never disappointed.  hard shell lobster is the best!  legal's doesn't disappoint.  our waitress was wonderful!  everyone enjoyed.  thank you!
2016-08-23,Kimberly,5.0,"had to take out co-workers visiting from the south, so we opted for legal so they could get a taste of good new england chowder and fish."
2016-08-21,Humanist,1.0,waiter forgot my drink. recommended a sampler plate full of small burned pieces of fish. won't be back.
2016-08-21,cheffie,4.0,"we always enjoy the meal; but did have an unusual incident. i saved all my shrimp and scallops from my  meal to take home. when the server presented the bill she didn't bring the take home.  later, after much delay and a reminder from me, she brought a small box. they had obviously lost my food and gave me 2 shrimp and 2 scallops, less than half of what i wanted to take home.   it was not mentioned that this was not my take home or i would checked the box to see what they had actually given me. this is not a big deal; but the servers should be more careful when a diner requests a take home package."
2016-08-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we were a party of 6 celebrating a birthday ""celebration"".  food was expensive , but mostly good. one meal was slightly overcooked.  our waiter , carlos, was fantastic. attentive, but not overly so,  entertaining, informative, lot's of fun."
2016-08-20,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we have always enjoyed dining at legal seafoods framingham however, in the past 2 years we have noticed a decline in the quality of the wait staff but the food has always been very good. on this occasion we were a party of 3 for dinner. there were a number of times during dinner when we had to wait quite a long time for service. the waiter never brought us rolls even after we mentioned it when he brought the drinks, so we asked the back waiter to bring rolls when the appetizer came. the waiter came and tried to take away the appetizer before it was finished (he did not ask if we were done). also one of our group was missing a knife after the appetizer plate was taken away and did not have an opportunity to ask the waiter for a knife until half way through our meal.  on a number of prior occasions we have only seen the waiter while ordering and then at the end of the meal. one of the qualities that distinguishes legals had been the service. but, unfortunately, no longer."
2016-08-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,caught up with high school friends and it was the perfect environment.  the waitress was awesome and friendly and the food was amazing.
2016-08-20,MaritaE,2.0,"i have frequented multiple legal seafoods over the years. this was my first time visiting the framingham location.  either the quality of food has changed or whomever prepared my food did not do a good job. from the first bite i knew that i had no plans in terms of finishing my meal.  it wasn't horrible, but i would never want to order from this establishment again.  thank you."
2016-08-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always great! can't go wrong with any dish.
2016-08-18,LauraD,4.0,"especially adaptive to gluten free options, so much choice and gf rolls for our gf free family member."
2016-08-17,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the food and drinks were  very good. we had the baked stuffed shrimp and bake hadock along with a gin and tonic. quality and quantity of food was excellent.  the server was friendly but forgot to bring out our appetizer and gave us the wrong check.  other than that this was a pleasant experience.
2016-08-16,Pastramiman,5.0,a little loud. not legal's fault. is everyone hard of hearing?
2016-08-16,FrequentLuncher,5.0,"very relaxed atmosphere for conversation, good food, attentive service"
2016-08-15,srfoodie,4.0,"the fish is always good and recipes are the same at different locations. we ordered grilled shrimp, cod and shrimp casserole - everyone enjoyed their meal. there was a power failure and we were glad that we had our food but less than 5 minutes and power back on. our server checked on us during outage. it's great to be able to choose onr's sides- their onion strings are really good. we were at the natick location and had a reservation so ensure timing for a movie. a repeat visit for all of us."
2016-08-13,phyllisp,5.0,the food and drinks are consistently great so why go anywhere else.
2016-08-13,CherylW,3.0,"the appetizer, fried clams, was the highlight. rolls were dry and fish in broiled assorted platter was over cooked and, hence, tasteless.  an extremely disappointing meal at a name restaurant chosen for reliabily consistent quality.  thumbs way down on a relatively simple dish."
2016-08-13,eg12,3.0,"i normally love legal seafoods and have eaten at the framingham restaurant many times. i was therefore very disappointed that two items i ordered (first, tuna sashimi, then crab salad) were not available - this has never happened, in my experience."
2016-08-11,BarrowBoys,3.0,food  quality is excellent. service is very slow during peak hours. pricey. tiny foil butter pats inappropriate for caliber of restaurant. fried clam appetizer is oversized. one skimpy bread roll per person.
2016-08-11,Ballou,5.0,always special.  crabmeat sandwich with zucchini and cole slaw plus bon-bons; spouse-mashed plus zucchini add bon-bons. great service!
2016-08-10,CyndiF,5.0,"the quality of the seafood is always fresh and consistent.  good selection.  i am from new england but live in florida so i enjoy legals whenever i am back.   there used to be one in boca but sadly, it's gone now."
2016-08-08,Gloria,5.0,we had a great family dinner on monday night.  our waitress was amazing.  i would totally go back.  my tuna was prepared perfect and my daughter ordered the shrimp which was beautifully prepared.
2016-08-07,DRCMetroWest,4.0,"sunday afternoon for lunch.  nice food and wine menu variety, reasonable cost, food and service were quite good"
2016-08-06,Aardvark42,5.0,"a great seafood dinner as always.
food fresh and delicious.
first class from start to finish."
2016-08-06,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"my favorite place to eat i love the food and the place!!
 
i definitely recommend  to everyone!!!"
2016-08-03,marjo,5.0,"our usual very good legal experience. food was excellent as was the service. wine by the glass was extensive and reasonable. our waiter omar was especially good (actually suggested we could have the broccoli cooked softer than the normal hard) we enjoyed our visit again. do have one question though, how come the seafood leader of boston with multiple restaurants (and we have been to many of them) does not offer one of the most popular seafoods - octopus???"
2016-08-03,Hudsontravelers,5.0,"we had not been to legal for a while. we were reminded why we enjoy this restaurant ,when we went to celebrate a birthday. the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. we will definitely return soon."
2016-08-02,JaniceE,5.0,excellent for lunch - delicious food and very fresh fish!
2016-07-30,sarahl,3.0,"we haven't been to legel seafoods in many years, we chose here as a middle point to meet my parents for my dads 89th bday, our waiter was awesome and very attentive, my only complaint if i had to give one would be the price for meals i and my husband ordered the fried seafood plate this ran about $30.00 each, the breading was mushy, fried plates should be nice and crispy, and it wasn't terribly hot when served, my dad had the grilled plate and said he was happy my mom had the stuffed shrimp and she seemed happy, but over all cost for meals and drinks is high and will keep us from coming back often, if prices were better we could then come more often for date night,  but will have to keep this for special occasions instead."
2016-07-30,OpenTable Diner,2.0,my lobster roll was the driest i have ever eaten in my entire life. how can that be? i've  lived in boston my entire life and never had a dried cold skimpy lobster roll.  it was really bad. i'm very sad.
2016-07-26,Snow,5.0,food and service both great. chrissy the gm checked in on us. she's a rock star!
2016-07-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"our waiter, omar, was fantastic. the food was perfect, as usual."
2016-07-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the food was exceptional all the way to dessert.  my niece who was visiting from san diego needed strict gluten-free preparation and she got it.  the staff was friendly and accommodating. we dropped by thursday on the way home from the airport for a late dinner, decided nothing else was better in the framingham-worcester area, so we returned saturday for a family dinner and were impressed again.  ask for tom with the handlebar moustache or alyssa c without the handlebar moustache."
2016-07-23,TerriL,5.0,"my husband and i went to legal seafoods for date night.  we love legal seafoods for its fresh fish, good service and clean bright ambiance.  

my husband got the clam chowder and seafood casserole.  

to start, i ordered their new summer salad - vine ripe tomato & manouri cheese salad with cucumber, basil, pickled red onion, extra virgin olive oil.  it was delicious!  i would definitely get it again!  for my main course, i ordered the grilled assortment which is the chef’s choice of three fish (tonight is was swordfish, salmon and tuna), shrimp, scallops, choice of two house sides.  everything was delicious and i have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow!"
2016-07-22,GordonHH,4.0,it was up to my expectation.  the business colleague with whom i was having lunch was from out of town and had never eaten at a legal seafood before.  he was happy with it.
2016-07-19,maddy,5.0,always enjoy it
2016-07-19,Ballou,5.0,"always first rate. one of our favorite sandwiches,  crabmeat, topped our selection with mashed and broccoli for my spouse and onion rings with jasmine rice for yours truly. bon-bons for desert completed our meal. can't beat legal for lunch!"
2016-07-18,Denbrook,5.0,as always a great experience. excellent service and wonderful food.
2016-07-16,NSILMike,5.0,both the service and the food were outstanding.   this is one of our favorites.
2016-07-16,PattyH,3.0,i was disappointed in the fish it was dry as the portion was not what inexpected for the price we always go to the sole proprietor in worcester and have never been dissatisfied we had to fonts the airport that evening and thought it would be nice to try legal as it has always been good but i was not happy this time sorry
2016-07-16,JessicaF,5.0,"i took my mom out as a special treat for her and everything was wonderful. my only regret, we didn't have room for dessert!"
2016-07-16,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the food quality is ok, but not great."
2016-07-15,Floss,4.0,"predictable, consistent, a tad noisy.  the fish is always fresh and well prepared.  wait staff are helpful and attentive."
2016-07-15,KkaJM,4.0,"we haven't been there for years but had a gift card to use.  we were pleasantly surprised.  it was much better than the last time we had been there.  the waiter was one of the best we have encountered anywhere - thoroughly professional, thoughtful and attentive.  he understood how to make the dinner work extremely well for a family dinner ( 4 generations).  we all enjoyed the evening."
2016-07-15,sjlfood,5.0,super service. everything was perfect.
2016-07-14,Ballou,5.0,"once again we were happy to have one of our favorite servers, judy,  take care of our every need. scallops for my wife with mashed and broccoli/cheese. i had the fried fish special (tempura) with the same sides. both of us had the delicious yogurt and fruit desert. by the way, pat made sure we had a great table. legal is framingham is first rate!"
2016-07-12,BobeC,5.0,always meets expectations. they set a high bar and the food is to notch and best value
2016-07-11,Chas,5.0,"although we had table reservations, we sat at the bar and enjoyed ourselves immensely."
2016-07-08,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent evening - wonderful attentive service.  food was excellent and i have always been pleased at this particular legal seafoods location.  it was a friday night and it was relatively quiet - sometimes it can be quiet loud on weekends.  location and parking are very convenient.  i enthusiastically recommend this restaurant!
2016-07-06,Jane,4.0,"this is a great place for small or large gatherings.  the service is always very pleasant and staff is attentive, but not intrusive.  in addition, the staff are very conscious about the allergies which is a bonus!"
2016-07-06,Comstock2,5.0,"we had an enjoyable experience overall, but our server, who was personable to be sure, was a little too ""are you sure?"" about everything. then, between appetizer/salad and entree we waited an inordinately long time. the night ended well enough with a plate of bonbons and some birthday singing. all's well that ends well, i guess."
2016-07-06,Ballou,5.0,"nelson, our waiter did a terrific job meeting our needs. i decided to have the crab meat roll (real crabmeat!) with tasty mashed potatoes and  green beans. my wife had the same but with scallops. both lunches were served hot with yummy rolls. we both had the yogurt/fruit desert-a nice, light ending to an early dinner. you can't go wrong with legal framingham."
2016-07-04,flowerlady,4.0,"as always, we enjoyed our meal.  we tend to select our favorites -- in this case,crab cake combo, grilled assortment, and cioppino.  i like to eat the seafood in the tasty stew and take home the rice mixed with the remaining broth and the lobster claw, which i can crack at home and add to the delicious rice mixture for a wonderful lunch.  the service was good, and we were glad to have a waitress who didn't gush ""my pleasure!"" each time she came to the table."
2016-07-03,EvaK,5.0,my husband and i enjoyed our dinner.  we shared a dozen cherrystone clams to start.  they were very fresh and very good.  i had the grilled haddock and he had the mixed grill assortment.  we were very satisfied with our choice.
2016-06-30,snowshoe,5.0,"nutty salmon was excellent and service was great, too....didn't like the way we had to wait for reservation/table, though--made me feel like i was at cheap restaurant...need to improve there...."
2016-06-28,TripAdvisor,5.0,"stopped in for some chowder and shrimp.  along with a glass of chardonnay, it was a perfect light meal as i wasn't very hungry.   sat in the bar area which was perfect as i could check out the ball game on the tv."
2016-06-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent for a meal with colleagues and business associates.   our server was very perceptive and didn't rush us, or interrupt when we were deep in conversation."
2016-06-27,PeterA,2.0,fish over cooked...had the texture of a hockey puck
2016-06-25,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"excellent food, service was so-so and the main dining room of the restaurant is starting to look a little dated."
2016-06-25,Lovesfish,5.0,as always - a wonderful consistent dining experience!
2016-06-24,foodie,3.0,"been to legal many, many times over the years.  current menu less appealing than those in the past and prices significantly higher.  moderately busy, but very noisy.  have enjoyed dining there and not likely to stop on this one experience, but....."
2016-06-23,Jauer3,4.0,"the quality of food at legal has always been outstanding, but overpriced. we go anyway because of the quality and choices. they have reduced the sides that are included forcing me to pay extra for the better ones. and the asparagus and hard cheese was tasty, but skimped on the cheese. the framingham location is very noisy, making conversation among a large group difficult. service is generally very good, but this time the waiter kept forgetting my beer."
2016-06-22,Ballou,5.0,can't beat the grilled dinner shrimp with mashed and cheese broccoli. scallops are a great choice as well. don't forget the bon-bons for desert.!
2016-06-22,Irisheyes826,2.0,we chose this restaurant due to past visits.  this visit was very very disappointing.  the service was extremely slow for the time we were there - our meal was also very disappointing.  having travelled all day we were looking forward to enjoying new england fried clams.  our meal was not good at all.  chewy old tasting clams was not what we had expected for the price that we had to pay.  this meal was definitely not up to the legal seafood quality.  will think twice before we return to try it again.
2016-06-21,StewartR,4.0,"very nice meal. shrimp and crab casserole a bit dry and tough (but not a fail), but the chocolate cake is outstanding.  clam chowder worth the trip. mostly everything is great, just wouldn't order this one dish again. beyond that i enjoy coming here and would go back at any time."
2016-06-20,Luv2doWIne,4.0,"good meal here with my sister. excellent fresh seafood. not inexpensive but well worth the trip.
will be returning and highly recommend."
2016-06-20,GoodfoodAwesomeService,4.0,"another great meal at legal.  had the ""everything tuna"" and it was just perfect along with the chowder and salad.    a great place and decent prices too."
2016-06-18,JimN,4.0,"excellent waiter. wish i could remember his name. the appetizers, calamari and buffalo popcorn shrimp, were excellent. drinks were large and very good. dinners were actually a little bland. the spice and lime snapper wasn't spicy and i got no citrus flavor at all; but snapper was cooked just right. the seafood casserole was a good size (huge shrimp) and cooked perfectly, but was also a little bland."
2016-06-17,BettyP,5.0,evening was great.  carlos was our waiter and he was so very pleasant and helpful.  food was great and very well-prepared.  it was a wonderful evening.
2016-06-16,TripAdvisor,4.0,"another fine meal here.  favorite spot in the area.  clam chowder is a must, had the grilled shrimp tonight for a change, very good.  we also had the blackened halibut.. always great.  fine service."
2016-06-15,Ellen,5.0,best food - best martini's - fabulous service. grilled assorted gives you a great variety of delicious fish - tried their warm chocolate pudding cake is gluten free and to die for!!
2016-06-15,hbsharon,4.0,always enjoy legals but it's gotten too pricey. portions are large.  food is good but now beyond going for a simple meal. server was ok but not engaged at al
2016-06-15,Ballou,5.0,great as always! the service without standing the food was tasty as usual. we were very happy to be able to get our favorite table. our waitress was outstanding!
2016-06-11,DanF,4.0,"has the seafood trio, scallops & shrimp were good, but the clams weren't up to par, a little chewy and didn't taste as good as usual. everything else was ok. waiter was training so that is forgiven."
2016-06-10,SusieT11,5.0,legals in framingham is one of our favorite restaurants. my husband and i love the rainbow trout dish and it is economical and delicious. the clam chowder is also fantastic. on our most recent visit we went with another couple to celebrate our anniversary. our server gave us a complimentary dessert...so nice. the food is always fresh and well prepared. we have never been disappointed
2016-06-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great service and delicious seafood. great way to celebrate our last night in ma.
2016-06-06,Annied,3.0,nice menu but high notice level. very impersonal service
2016-06-06,out2dine,5.0,"our waitress gave us great service and took the time to make sure we had a very enjoyable dinner.  the restaurant was very busy serving groups. we haven't been here for a while and were glad to return.  the decor and seating is relaxing and nautical.  we tried the lite clam chowder, but really prefer the chowder with more calories. grilled swordfish was delicious and tender. the seafood dish with lobster, scallops, and calamari in a  light tomato broth was excellent and definitely a reason to return. the ice cream bon bons were a nice finish to the meal."
2016-06-06,Ballou,5.0,great food and service as always !
2016-06-05,Dickie,5.0,good food. always !
2016-06-04,GearyS,4.0,great food at a last minute notice to celebrate my daughters birthday
2016-05-28,OpenTable Diner,2.0,we were disappointed in our meals. we all felt our meals were relatively bland. the service was somewhat slow. not in a hurry to return.
2016-05-28,CeeJay,5.0,"the meal was excellent, which was no less than we were expecting.  each of us (2 couples) ordered something different and all were beautifully prepared.  my husband, who always asks for salmon very rare, got it just the way he likes it, which often is not the case.  the sides were very good as well and the service professional.  there are only two problems:  the price, which is high for a piece of fish no matter how well-prepared, and the noise level, which is also high.   oh, and they were out of their dessert of the day, disappointing, as we left not long after 7pm.    they are just the best for fish."
2016-05-28,AudreyWC,5.0,"food was perfect, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.  our food came fresh and hot we couldn't have asked for a better experience!"
2016-05-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,fantastic food. even better service. celebrating a special occasion today and the staff was incredibly thoughtful
2016-05-26,Aliquisafrica,5.0,a fabulous meal in tranquil surroundings - great service
2016-05-26,EmptyNesters,5.0,the food was delicious and the service extraordinary.  loved the key lime pie and our server brought birthday bon bons to the table for my mother's  76 birthday.
2016-05-22,HSquare,4.0,"this was a sunday evening, not overly busy, but the waiter took our order then forgot about us. no water, no rolls, no drinks until we flagged another waiter down and requested these items.

the waiter also never checked if our food was acceptable, but we right there at the end when we were ready to pay the tab."
2016-05-22,EdwardL,5.0,"as usual, a great meal in a clean restaurant with a friendly staff"
2016-05-21,PatriciaB,5.0,"great food, great atmosphere! always have a terrific meal!"
2016-05-21,John,4.0,"always a treat, with good food and service.  a busy and bustling place but appropriate.
the only complaint we had (and we have had it before) is that we were very cold.  i had to wear my light outdoor jacket.  we are elderly and realize that the management can't accommodate everyone, but to have the restaurant not quite as cold would have pleased us more.  the temperature is the reason for the two stars for ambience.  otherwise we were pleased."
2016-05-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"legal seafood is one of the few places where i can find my favorite fish, the arctic char.  i and my granddaughter, who graduated from bu that weekend both enjoyed that very much.  the others in the party enjoyed other excellent selections. the service was a little slow because the restaurant was busy, but it was worth the wait."
2016-05-14,CatolT,5.0,"our server was really wonderfully attentive.   o ur appetisers: seared tuna and mussels, were excellent.     my glass of california wine was outstanding.      my asian fish taco was just so-so, but my son ate up his seafood casserole.     all in all, a very pleasant lunch."
2016-05-13,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the food was very good. clam chowder lobster ice. the noise level is way too high.
2016-05-13,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"my husband and i went for a nice friday night dinner.  hadn't been in quite some time.  service was excellent, we didn't feel rushed but didn't have to wait forever for food either.  food was very good and will definitely go more often."
2016-05-08,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the food was great - the only problem was the little teenagers they have as hostess . pretty rude and had no regard for people with small children.
2016-05-08,Firstvisit2021,5.0,thank you for taking such great care of our group on mother's day.  the food was fantastic and service was top notch !!!
2016-05-08,EnjoyingTheMoments,5.0,"the standard to for all crab cakes to be measured by.  hard to put into words – you have to experience them.  i ordered one a year ago as an appetizer and came back with the agenda of ordering as an entree.  so extraordinary.  
and the boston cream dessert – oh – you've got to try it!
thank you for you passion to sea food that is transforming!"
2016-05-06,JaneO,4.0,our waiter was very patient with us..we had a leisurely lunch!
2016-05-05,gigi,5.0,thanks so much for the gluten free accommodation !!!!!
2016-05-04,Rapunzel,2.0,"the pasta in my dish was overcooked.  since it was the main part of my dish, i did not eat most of my meal.  i was very disappointed as i had come specially for that meal.  

our food was not checked on until we were both finished with our meals.  at that point, i was not going to send it back.

the service was not great.  i do not fault the server for this.  it was busy in the restaurant, yet it seemed understaffed. the servers were rushing around, which made it a stressful environment.  

we were looking for a relaxing night out together, a romantic dinner.  it did not work out that way.  i think we might look elsewhere for our next special meal."
2016-05-01,Local,3.0,"the food is always good, little improvements could make it great.  the onion strings are very good when hot, ours arrived warm,the fries were the same.  the oysters, shrimp and steamers were excellent!"
2016-04-23,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the cost of the food was expensive in comparison to other places with the same size plates.
2016-04-22,Never2cook,5.0,best foods & service!
2016-04-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"celebrating a friends 65th birthday--had a great time.  waiter chad was fantastic--food was delicious and a great presentation--the rolls were delightful--the ""birthday slice"" with a candle and the chocolate drippings spelling out ""happy 65th connie"" was beautiful.  we are looking forward to our next visit--ray johnson, 136 west mt. rd., bernardston, ma (home of kringle candle and the farm table restauran)--rayofsunshine (ray johnson)"
2016-04-18,LTNahant,4.0,great food and service as always
2016-04-17,GregM,5.0,"soft-shelled crabs are always a treat, especially when the kitchen is flexible in their preparation."
2016-04-16,Ellen,5.0,as always the food was great and having severe celiac disease it's always a comfort to know i am safe. best fish and portions sizes perfect. even our friends who are not huge seafood people loved their meals of grilled assortment and jasmine special.
2016-04-16,STaa25,5.0,"it has been quite a while since my last visit (like more than 12 years).  they took the fish tank out of the floor at the entrance.  the bar appears to have been redone somewhat.  that had several of the games on tv (the red sox, etc.).  the nutty faroe island salmon came recommended.  it was superb."
2016-04-10,JulieT,5.0,"we were seated immediately (party of 4).  our waitress was helpful & happy.  service was efficient.  one meal came out with the fish too rare.  it was no problem to fix it.  all other meals were done well.  we stayed after our meal chit chatting, no one rushed us to leave.  it was an enjoyable experience."
2016-04-10,MRSGFC,4.0,the meal was delicious and our waiter omar was a gem.
2016-04-09,Angela,3.0,food is always good at legal.  service is good as well.  i gave it an overall rating of 3 stars because we always make a reservation but still have to wait when we get there.  very annoying.
2016-04-07,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the food was good, though i feel quite over priced for the amount.  one member of our party received her meal and it was not hot.  cooke but not hot...left under the warming lights too long.  our waiter did a good job.  the noise level was very high.  felt like i was eating in a cafeteria type place.  overall a little disappointed."
2016-04-02,Retiredteacher,5.0,"food was excellent.  we had the bang bang cauliflower, out of this world, chilean sea bass, yum, and jasmin shrimp dish.  all were plentiful, hot, and full of flavor.  service was excellent.  only down side was it was a bit noisy."
2016-04-02,JenC,4.0,"food was excellent. fried clam app was delicious.  fresh-tasting and tried to perfection. clam bellies were quite small but i account that to the season.  service was good.  our server was friendly and helpful, but seemed overextended.  food was somewhat slow coming."
2016-04-01,Mark,5.0,excellent food was excellent
2016-04-01,Ballou,5.0,love the faroe island salmon and the lunch sea scallops! bon bons are always fun for desert.

2016-03-28,Abby,5.0,"very nice, they sang happy bday to my mom :-) would def go back."
2016-03-28,TripAdvisor,4.0,"usually have halibut, shrimp, or lobster here but tonight had the king crab... so good!  love the chow here.  excellent service, good atmosphere, fine chow and nice wine pricing."
2016-03-27,JandJ,4.0,"easter afternoon and very busy. but our waiter was not interested in us. would ask if we wanted a refill, for example, and then forget to bring it. waited a while for the check."
2016-03-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,floor staff kept hovering around the tables with ipads checking on table potential availability.- that made the dining very uncomfortable especially as we were in a small room. complained to the manager on the way out.
2016-03-22,JustinoV,5.0,"top quality food. ordered one appetizer , three main dishes and two desserts, still arguing about which one was the best!"
2016-03-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,there is nothing i would change about this place it is the best place around i wish i could eat here everyday
2016-03-12,MerylK,4.0,everything was fine but the food when served was tepid at best
2016-03-06,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"we had a 615 reservation.  did not get seated until 635.  did not get served anything, not even water, until nearly 7:30.   after not seating us promptly, took nearly 15 min for our waiter to come over, and then she didn't bring our drinks or even water or bread until our appetizers were ready.  after that service was ok, but just not nearly acceptable service for the price.  and all they did was take off the cost of two salads; for service that poor a larger price accommodation would have been appropriate.  we go to legals all the time, but i will not go to this location again if i can avoid it."
2016-03-06,dsmack10,2.0,"to start with, i've always been a huge fan of legals. it's generally always consistently good. this was not a bad meal, but it was by no means in the good or very good category. we arrived on time for our reservation, and were seated after a slight delay. the restaurant was bustling. we ordered appetizers. one of the ""special"" appetizers was the rhode island calamari, which is a favorite of mine. it is described as spicy and greasy, which is should be. it was neither. it was bland, flavorless, boring, and was simply fried calamari. our server never returned to check on it for quite a while. so we left it there. when we told him, he did say sorry, and nothing else. we also had the steamed mussels which were very good.  when our meals came, i ordered a grilled 3 fish special. i was served 3 fried fish, which i sent back. now we have a small child, so they were eating and i was sitting there with my incorrect order (which was taken away). i had to stop the waiter to get my drink refilled, and it wasn't until nearly desert which our waters were refilled for the 1st time. when my meal came, it got 0 points for presentation. it just looked grilled and tossed on a plate to speed up for their error. while good, it was just the lack of attention to detail, bland food, and nothing done to fix the errors which left this an an overall disappointing experience. to be blunt, i expect more from legals, this was my spouse's birthday and left an overall bad taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively."
2016-03-06,OpenTable Diner,3.0,typical high quality experience with legal seafoods
2016-03-05,ArisP,1.0,i invited two other couples for a saturday evening. the service was incredibly slow. the fish was overcooked and bland. disappointing when paying an above average price for a meal.
2016-03-05,Anniesnanny,5.0,i was pleased that they honored my request (which i made with my open table reservation) for a quiet table.  wonderful waiter - knowledgeable and attentive.
2016-03-05,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we asked for another table due to an occasional cold draft, and the staff could not have been more gracious, and we were quickly reseated.  
i'm very timid when it comes to ordering fish, and i rarely order fish, other than salmon or fish & chips.  somehow, when our waiter, tim, the fellow with the old fashioned handle-bar mustache, described the steelhead trout, i thought i would take a chance and throw caution to the wind.  
the trout was one of the best meals i've had, every part of it: the perfectly done, tender, flavorful fish, the roasted linguine, the roasted asparagus, the sauce.
tim was also terrific and contributed greatly to our lovely dinner birthday celebration.  he's a real pro, there enough for the best service, but not intrusive.  he made my wife's 73rd birthday even more special.
the restaurant was completely packed, but the noise level was still low enough for us to converse comfortably."
2016-03-01,Elena,5.0,"great ""leap year"" deal!!"
2016-02-29,Ironman,5.0,"had the twin boiled lobster special, and it was very good.   fried onion rings also a fave, light and tasty.  nice steamers seasoned with thyme, and chowder great as usual."
2016-02-29,MadeleineO,5.0,"we had clam chowder , fish chowder, steamed lobster, onion strings, rice and cole slaw! everything was fabulous as always!"
2016-02-29,Bottomline222,4.0,"my wife and i got a jump on summer with the lobster special on february 29. great deal and great lobster.

a few days before we stopped for lunch and i had the gumbo. great taste- what there was of it. honest if there was a cup of gumbo in the bowl it was a lot. a bowl of gumbo 1/4 inch deep is not a ""bowl""."
2016-02-28,TerryD,3.0,the lettuce in my and my companion's salad was chopped too small and was very hard to eat. i could not even spear it with my fork it was so small (really needed a spoon). lettuce should be torn loosely to give it its best flavor. very disappointed in the salads.
2016-02-28,ArnetteM,5.0,delilah as always!
2016-02-28,ScanClan11,4.0,"it was mainly a good experience. even with a reservation we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. it was loud but not unexpected on a saturday night. our waitress was wonderful, but spilled a glass of water on the table and my husband. she was very apologetic and the manager came over to check in as well. not that it was expected, but there was no offer of a free beverage or dessert or any other type of offering to make up for the inconvenience."
2016-02-28,TriciaM,5.0,food was excellent!
2016-02-27,sibud,2.0,"my wife and i went there february 28, 2016 we had muscles oysters littlenecks and clam chowder in the next 48 hours was not very pleasant needless to say we probably will not go back"
2016-02-27,eagle,5.0,the wait staff and chefs were very helpful with our child's food allergies.  thank you!
2016-02-20,phyllisp,5.0,"we always sit at the bar or high top in bar area. we had a high top with friends, had wine, and fantastic food. two of us had the nutty salmon, my favorite, and one had tuna. (i forget what the other had.) the atmosphere is upbeat and the food can't be beat. we always share a caesar salad which they divide in the kitchen-great salad."
2016-02-19,anonymous,2.0,my crabmeat salad on a roll was basically mayonnaise on a hot dog bun for $18.  terrible!
2016-02-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"overall was a great experience as always. perhaps our waiter just forgot about us from time-to-time (and he got a few of our items wrong), but no complaints otherwise. everything there is alway so delicious. can't wait for our next visit."
2016-02-14,ZafrienK,4.0,it was an overall good experience. out waiter could have been a bit more attentive but it was a bit busy. we  were not given a wine list when we were seated and by the time our waiter came with the wine list we were a bit rushed to order.
2016-02-14,jsands222,5.0,dined with friends.  we all really enjoyed the meal.  quality always meets expectations.  service was also good.  a little noisy given it was very crowded.
2016-02-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,took the kids on a saturday night and we were very pleased. the service was friendly and very attentive to outer needs. i was pleasantly surprised with the food portions. all four of us enjoyed the whole experience and the food was delish!
2016-02-14,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"i'm a huge ls fan, so was pretty bummed when our food quality was substandard the usual awesome fare. our osyters were fantastic, but that's about where the good stuff ended. our champagne was served warm (waitress didn't know how to get the cage off without using her wine key knife...odd), char grilled tuna ordered medium rare came out well done, with a random rare spot on the edge, broccoli was likely flash boiled for a moment - it was cold and barely cooked by the time i got to it, husband's lobster wasn't very flavorful and the chocolate mousse dessert was almost entirely whipped cream. the waitress did remove the tuna from our bill when she confirmed the same overcooked tuna as well. this experience won't stop me from visiting, but i likely won't come to this location again."
2016-02-13,ctha,5.0,always great food every time i go to this location.
2016-02-10,Mumsedso,5.0,"well informed servers. always reliable food.  great food, high prices but can go there without worry. if you want to impress and you love fish/seafood this is a tried and true place to dine"
2016-02-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food and service are very good, but the place is noisy."
2016-02-05,KarenP,5.0,"food and service are always top notch.   this bar is really comfortable, perfect lighting and seating.  and you know the fish you ordered is the fish you'll be getting!  can't beat the quality!"
2016-01-31,Cynthia,3.0,"i must be me... i love legal but again ordered anna's
cod to receive it wet and mushy.
our terrific waitress judy wrote the order for cooked though fish,dry plate and edible broccoli.
she was trying to avoid same issue last week!

watery mushy fish again.

manager comped the meal - who cares, the problem lies in a kitchen that can't broil a piece of cod.

my husband had harder to cook trout - excellent!

i'm really sorry but my quest was a good lunch, not
a free lunch.

sincerely,
cc hill"
2016-01-24,CupcakeWonk,3.0,mom and dad's go to option.
2016-01-23,HockeyMom,5.0,went there for lunch which is a better value than paying their dinner prices. i would recommend the bang bang cauliflower appetizer and the fish tacos. service was prompt. i had a reservation and was disappointed when the hostess wanted to give us a table near the kitchen. we then asked for a booth and were relocated. the restaurant was not busy. don't know why we were located near the kitchen but i suspect the hostess was new.
2016-01-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"was seated as soon as we arrived, food was good, service was good. only complaint would be the table next to us, 13-14 young lady needed some manners, adults just sat there."
2016-01-20,Ellen,5.0,i can honestly say i've never had a bad meal at here. salads and fish the freshest  - service fabulous - reservations always on time.
2016-01-18,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"no restaurant can compare to legal seafood when it comes to baked stuffed lobster.  unlike some preparations that take off the claws and/or remove the tail meat, you get the whole lobster.  ours was enhanced with delectable shrimp and scallops.  the claw and tail meat were as moist as they would have been if we had ordered a boiled live lobster.  the cracker stuffing was perfect, not bread-laden or cloying.  my only disappointment in the meal was the dessert:  the belgian mousse was cakey rather than smooth, sugarless and therefore inedible.  someone in the kitchen must have messed up the recipe somehow."
2016-01-18,Gezz,3.0,"crab cakes were great, coconut shrimp overcooked and the fish (in the fish and chips) was thin and the batter not crisp."
2016-01-16,Janet9477,4.0,i always order the swordfish at legal sea foods.  it comes grilled with butter and garlic. it has never disappointed me. it is perfection!
2016-01-15,parisamsterdam12,3.0,"legal's can do better. haddock (tasty) and jasmine rice unappealing in its bland presentation. the plate was cafeteria style.  my friend 's dinner was a bit more colorful, but still lacked a stylish presentation."
2016-01-15,fwr3,3.0,"find the wine selection is becoming more the reason we eat at legal rather than the food. the 
food is pretty consistent;  pretty consistently in the ""good"" category. 
service was very attentive and professional.
and, the clam chowder really is very good.
but the wines are interesting and well chosen and we nearly always find an excellent wine that we haven't had before."
2016-01-15,PattyP,4.0,"we always love legal's, and as it was chowder day (yearly celebration that nets diners a cup of legal's amazing chowder for only $1) we especially wanted to have lunch there. we were not disappointed. our meals were excellent - wedge salad and shrimp tacos accompanied by both the chowder and a dozen cherry stone clams. so delicious! everything was so fresh and well prepared. our server was excellent."
2016-01-10,NayC,5.0,"came in for my husbands birthday and had a great time, food was delicious (bang bang cauliflower apetizer is amazing!!) service was flawless! thank you!"
2016-01-09,CFLGlobal,5.0,"this restaurant not only serves best seafood in the area, it is accompanied with great service and speedy execution. i have visited this restaurant many times and it is my top 2 restaurant selection when i visit the huge natick mall area. yes, i actually drive out from the mall and go to eat in this restaurant and drive back. i have tried almost all the food from lobster ... all the way to boston cream pie (to me, it is the best boston cream pie, ... i know i must not forget this is seafood restaurant). since this restaurant is full most of the time, i make sure you use open table to reserve... otherwise waiting time may be involved. the waiter and waitress have can-do spirit and never disappoints."
2016-01-02,Chas,4.0,"as it was my daughter's birthday, i noted that when i made our reservation.  the wait staff was not notified, as i thought they would be, and therefore nothing special was done for her.  usually a dessert comes out with happy birthday written on it, or something special to mark the occasion.  i was disappointed."
2016-01-02,MtWashingonInnVacay,5.0,"we arrived a few minutes before 6:00pm on that saturday night and the place was packed - people were waiting for tables.  sure glad we used open table to make a reservations... no waiting.. swoosh...the hostess brought us to our table ! -she said we were smart for making the reservation! if you love lobster, shrimp and scallops get the baked stuffed lobster. it's buttery stuffing has scallop and shrimp.   -- absolutely delicious!"
2016-01-02,Rivergirl,3.0,"the great thing about legals is that you can't go wrong with their food.it's consistently very good.   we visited framingham at 5pm on a saturday while we were coming back from a nearby event.   it was extremely busy and we were told that the wait would be 45 min -1hour.  while waiting, we went onto open table to see if any nearby restaurants had  availability.  it actually showed a reservation for 2 open at legals framingham for 5:15!  so we booked it.  i immediately told the host and let him know that we expect that was a fluke.   given how busy it was, we said we don't mind waiting.  he wasn't sure what to make of it,  and although pleasant, he  did tell me that they ""never"" honor reservations made within the hour but he would check with his manager.  we patiently waited for about a half hour then noticed parties who came in after us without reservations were getting seated.
we inquired and were told that we were next.   there was such chaos in seating people, that we were passed over again.  i then went up to a manager and inquired and was assured we'd be immediately seated and that someone was clearing a table.   that too came and went. we were ready to walk out when they sat us.  each person at the host stand claimed the other was supposed to take care of it. our waitress was excellent.  in watching the staff (hosts, wait staff and bar staff), it was clear that it was very chaotic. the right hand didn't seem to know what the left hand was doing and frustration was apparent. one employee cut her hand and there was no attempt by management to help to cover for her while she took care of things.  this is why was stopped going to the framingham location years ago.  it's disappointing to see things haven't changed. we won't be returning.   if legals doesn't honor reservations made within the hour, perhaps they should tell open table members this when they reserve."
2016-01-02,jswims,5.0,we five were seated in a booth and our reservation was earlier than the rush. we had great food service and all raved about our experience. definitely a place to go again!
2016-01-02,likestoeatwell,4.0,"fresh, inventive seafood.  not your mother's legal seafood.  fun spin on conventional dishes.  side of polenta with jalapeno and cheddar.  freshly made steamed shrimp wontons.  wood grilled salmon was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and a generous serving.  would recommend."
2016-01-02,Batman,2.0,even with a reservation we have to wait. at chestnut hill we are welcomed back by the manager. at framingham it takes forever to get the food and when it comes it is dry and cold. i would return to chestnut hill in a heartbeat but we are done with framingham. by the way this was our second visit in a month. we hoped our experience the first time was a fluke   unfortunately it was repeated the second time.
2016-01-02,YaRy1234,5.0,"friendly,i love this place the waiter was helping and good"
2016-01-01,DougB,5.0,"legal is famous for excellent seafood.  the menu seemed more limited than in the past, but what they had was very good.  the tuna special was excellent, including the chef-selected side dishes.  my wife had the swordfish, which was also quite nice."
2016-01-01,Andi,3.0,"our service was poor.  we were very disappointed because generally the service is top notch.  the waitress was in attentive and a little forgetful.    in addition, two of the people in our party ordered baked potatoes.  one of the ""managers""came to our table to tell us that they were out of potatoes and asked what they wanted in place of them.  they both said mashed with extra butter and sour cream.  when our dinners finally came, they were minus the mashed.  another ""manager"" came repeated the baked potato situation and they told him again what they wanted.  luke warm mashed potatoes with none of the extras.  then our waitress came over and they asked for the butter....waited....waited...no waitress...started to complain at our table and another server heard us and got us the butter.

we got a few free desserts for the long dinner wait but it was new year's eve...it should have been better."
2016-01-01,Mark,5.0,food was absolutely delicious as always. assorted grille gave the best of the sea on one dish.
2015-12-31,Master,1.0,"i've been coming to this restaurant for 12 years now and the service that i received on thursday wasn't good enough.  my lobster wasn't cooked properly and i tried not to make a big deal and just to bag it. i love this place but this was a turn off for me, especially after spending  $250.00."
2015-12-30,foodie,2.0,"legals has been a favorite of mine for over 30 years.  it's our go to for birthday celebrations and that's where we went for my birthday this year.  our server was friendly but we waited a  very long time between courses.  legals always cooks their fish perfectly but this was the first time that my shrimp was dry and overcooked.  my daughters were very happy with their salmon dishes.  the ice cream chocolates and bananas foster we had for dessert were a big hit.  overall, it's not what i would expect for a bill almost 300.00.  first time ever i wasn't thrilled with our overall experience."
2015-12-30,Morty,5.0,we are frequent guests at legal seafoods.  we have been for 30 years.  the food and the preparation continues to be the highest quality.  keep up the great work!
2015-12-29,Ellen,4.0,consistently good seafood and efficient service. interesting specials. nice venue for family get- togethers.
2015-12-28,SoleFan,2.0,"our waiter,  jose, must have still been in training. drinks took a half hour to arrive. he also didn't know what ""scotch on the rocks, with a side of club soda"" meant. appetizer orders were incorrect and then delayed. subsequent drink orders took forever. one of our party was told the restaurant was out of prosecco, which was incredible and not to be believed. the waiter seemed confused, and at a loss to explain anything. food was fine, but the poor service made it a night to forget, rare for legal.  additionally, the ladies room was a mess---untidy, overflowing trash bins, and sloppy sinks.  lastly, the bill was incorrect, with one more drink on there than ordered, but after two hours, we were done with legal for the evening. we've been coming to legal sea foods (in several restaurants in numerous locations) for special occasions and for corporate parties for 15+ years, and it's sad to see the quality of the experience decline."
2015-12-28,flowerlady,5.0,"our experience was excellent, as always.  one thing that pleases me is that fried dishes may be made gluten-free.   one son has had a seafood combination platter prepared gluten-free and declares it to be as good as the standard offering.   i love the cioppino, which is a seafood mix in a tasty broth accompanied by a garlic toast which is really a treat on its own.   at the end of the meal i like to mix the rice side dish in with the remaining broth to take home for a tasty lunch.  i've eaten at legal many times over the years and never been disappointed."
2015-12-27,Babs,5.0,"excellent seafood across the board. we started with a beautifully presented assorted seafood platter that included 2 lobster claws, shrimp and an array of oysters & clams on the half-shell.  the clam chowder was amazing as always. i was delighted with the nutty faroe island salmon, and was especially pleased with the sides of mushroom ravioli and spinach. the shrimp and garlic pasta was also a big hit.  our server was very attentive and had great recommendations when asked. we will definitely be back!"
2015-12-26,Gonzo,2.0,"legal seafoods continues to lose its flair and unless they change their now boring menu, people will fail to keep going here.

the best part of the restaurant is the bar and if your goal is to have a drink and quick appetizers, this is your place.

there are much better seafood places in boston now and the traditional menu is getting old. i tried a new entree, but it was just a twist to the bluefish with mustard, which i have had before, hardly imaginative.

the staff keeps this place going, because if it was not for them, people would not come. our bill was extremely high and we definitely did not receive the value for our meal.

we've been going here for the last 20 years, but i am not dining there anymore. especially when their best food is the chowder and i might as well just take it to go!"
2015-12-26,DocMom2nana,5.0,"thanks for being open.  service, food, everything ... outstanding.  appreciate the staff being there and having great attitudes.  saw a nice spirit of folks working together that night.  makes guests feel very welcome!"
2015-12-26,Food2diefor,4.0,happy to find legal open on christmas day.  great to have a choice other than chinese! other than a delay in getting waited on (due to some larger groups in the bar) our experience was outstanding.  great draft beer and the food was fresh and delicious! our eventual waitperson was attentive and very friendly.
2015-12-25,Mike,4.0,"legal is always a great place for fish, and this christmas day evening visit was no exception.  the friendly waitress brought our chowder and rolls quickly, but the main course ended up taking 40 minutes  more. the waitress repeatedly stopped by to apologize. eventually the manager did too, and offered to comp the chowders. all this without a peep of complaint by me or my wife. never did find out why things took so long, but thought the folks at legal handled the situation well. no one is perfect, and after all, it was a holiday night.  this remains one of our favorite restaurants- for the food and the service."
2015-12-25,BMW2,5.0,waiter was excellent. food was delicious. awesome meal!
2015-12-25,Katadin,5.0,every time i have eaten here the meals have been consistently good.  expensive but worth it.
2015-12-25,Leominster,4.0,"excellent service, a rare spot on christmas day!  it has become a tradition. thank you to all the servers and staff who worked that day. the place was really buzzing. many elderly family members taken out for a good time. a good time was had by all. the tuna was too dry, overcooked?"
2015-12-25,Bonnie,5.0,we had a wonderful relaxing time! the food was great! thank you so much.
2015-12-25,2Bringbacktheolddays,3.0,has changed tremendously over the years..not for the best. seafood platter mostly consists of calamari and white fish (not cod /haddock). clam plate 1/3 amount you used to get; hidden in a pile of fries. way over priced. won't be returning. better seafood restaurants out there. gave it my last shot!
2015-12-24,DonnaMWHV,5.0,"the food was tasty and came out in a timely manner and the atmosphere was lively but not noisy. however, it was our waiter, carlos, that helped to make our christmas eve a memorable one. friendly and attentive but not intrusive on our family celebration, carlos was a welcome addition to our wonderful night."
2015-12-24,NatickDiner,4.0,legal level meal. drink service was slow. food was very good
2015-12-22,cutes1125,4.0,"celebrated a coworker who is retired now - from start to finish everything we order is delicious and flavorful.  started off with trio calamaris (spicy thai, original, and ri style). our entrees cioppino, shrimp double stuffed, and grilled assortment.  this place is only for celebration not daily because price range is too pricey."
2015-12-20,Boytoy,2.0,"service bad, food overpriced, no spices, no salt/pepper on table,
would advise everyone going to be forwarded
$170 wasted"
2015-12-18,Average,3.0,"we were seated and forgotten.

waiter got our order wrong, too much noise. they scurried to correct. slow on the follow up side."
2015-12-17,Ballou,5.0,the staff at legal makes the difference. this well run member of the legal organization has never let us down.. the scallops were outstanding. the seasonal desert is exceptional.
2015-12-16,JanP,4.0,"gosh, legal seafood is so reliable. it is wonderful fresh fish every time. they really do a great job"
2015-12-14,FoodieWhoCares,2.0,why does legal blare loud music in its dining rooms? it's highly annoying and offensive. i couldn't wait to leave.
2015-12-13,JimN,4.0,"i've eaten at legal's many times over the years. the menu always has something new, plus there's always the go-to dinners. most important, the seafood is always fresh and perfectly cooked; you'd be surprised how many places overcook calamari. i thought the service was a little slow, though they were very busy for an early sunday dinner. otherwise, everything was as expected, which is to say excellent."
2015-12-12,CWPost,4.0,"we were on time for our 6:30 pm reservation and were promptly seated, despite the restaurant being full.  service was good, ambiance was nice, and the food was prepared well, as we're accustomed to at other legals.  all around, a fine experience in the middle of the busy christmas rush."
2015-12-12,Rich,4.0,"as i usually expect from legal, good food and service."
2015-12-12,Sean,4.0,"we had a great table in the corner for 6 ppl and the service staff was great when we found out we actually had 7.  very accommodating and fun staff that made sure we were always taken care of during our meal.

i'm sure you already know this but they have some of the best oyster and seafood platters in town.  i had the grilled assortment which had swordfish, salmon, shrimp and scallops.  great dish and great portions.

advice - be sure to make a reservation.  this place always seems busy and for a good reason."
2015-12-07,markD,4.0,always solid. always fresh.
2015-12-06,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"waiter was very prefession, service was awesome food was great! can't wait to go back."
2015-12-05,Barry,5.0,food and service were excellent. i loved the surprise birthday dessert of ice cream bon bons - a sweet touch to a birthday supper!
2015-11-29,DavidS,3.0,"we have been to legal many times, and save it for special occasions.  this was the first time that the service was awful, and i was served the thinnest piece of swordfish that i have ever had"
2015-11-29,Afh714,5.0,still one of our go-to places. excellent gluten free choices. they even give gluten free rolls so that you're not sitting there starving while your fellow diners are filling their stomachs.
2015-11-28,Fran,1.0,"for the 4th time, our meal either came cold or over or under cooked. i am a chef and there is no excuse"
2015-11-26,dinnerwithdad,5.0,five of my family went to legal for thanksgiving dinner.  the entire menu was available plus a good turkey dinner with all the fixings.  so there was something for everyone and everyone went home happy.
2015-11-26,irepra,5.0,the food is delicious and i would recommend it to anyone who wants quality well prepared seafood.
2015-11-26,dajuna83,4.0,"we hoped for but didn't expect a delicious meal at a restaurant on thanksgiving.  we were pleasantly surprised by the freshness and tastiness of our selections (wood fired fish with shrimp and scallops for me and seared tuna for my husband).  i would
definitely recommend  legal seafood."
2015-11-26,Dale,5.0,legall seafoods doesn't disappoint. we went for thanksgivng dinner and enjoyed excellent turkey as well as the best swordfish .
2015-11-26,Phyllis,4.0,we can always count on a fresh and tasty fish meal at legal sea foods
2015-11-23,Terri,5.0,i recently enjoyed lunch at legal seafood with a group of co-workers.  we sat at a round table which allowed for excellent conversation amongst the entire group.  we shared a calamari appetizer and everyone agreed that it was perhaps the best calamari app ever!  the service was just right and everyone enjoyed their meal.
2015-11-22,Jack,5.0,"went to legal's with two long time friends, neither of whom live near good seafood.  had a great time.  never felt rushed (this was a sunday evening) to finish and get out."
2015-11-21,GinnyA,4.0,"our server, tom, was very thorough, professional, and very receptive to our request and questions."
2015-11-21,TripAdvisor,4.0,"stopped in for another nice dinner with my family.  enjoyed the baked stuffed shrimp, clam chowder, salads, crab cakes.... all very good.  leandro was an excellent waiter, efficient, friendly, professional."
2015-11-18,TJFoodlover,2.0,"the service was slow, check took forever to arrive, my fried clams were too chewy but entrees my colleagues selected were described as very good."
2015-11-16,JonB,4.0,"legal seafoods has evolved to a reliable go-to for business, to take out of town guests, and in this case, for a nice anniversary dinner.  they take reservations these days (actually have for years) and they seated us right away as we arrived, offering either a white tablecloth hightop in the bar, or a seat in the dining room.  we took the dining room since we don't like tv's during dinner.
the dining room in framingham is a hit and miss affair.  exposed ducts vie with stuffed sharks and blue & white checkerboard light fixtures for attention.  seating is varied with tables in open space, booths and two levels in the main room, plus a medium sized second room.  you can hear nearby tables, but conversation is possible and the noise level is reasonable.
legal has a good bar, and i enjoyed a pour of corazon anjejo tequila while my wife had a nice german riesling.  we shared a bowl lobster bisque that the waitress nicely split into two cups, each with a few nice bites of lobster meat.  the broth was rich and buttery, but could have used a bit more lobster flavor and sherry.  my wife had the chef's special with three fishes plus scallops and shrimp - all cooked a bit more than necessary, especially the tuna, but plenty for lunch the next day.  i had a special of cod loin with bacon-scallion rice which was very good with a spicy shandong sauce.  as usual, we had no room for dessert but the special cheesecake sounded wonderful.
so, how did we enjoy our anniversary dinner?  very much - just as we expected at legal."
2015-11-16,sunny,3.0,"the fish is certainly fresh and well prepared. it is, however, overpriced. the portions are adequate. service is acceptable. overall, i would not recommend legal seafoods. the prices are not in accordance with the quality of the meals."
2015-11-14,JoelG,3.0,"a little disappointed. been to many legal seafood restaurants, and had great meals. this time the food was just ok, not great. we were seated abutting a heavy traffic area, and it was very noisy; wanted to chat with old friends, but wasn't to be. i must say the service was great; excellent waitress, as is always the case with legal staff."
2015-11-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we recently celebrated my birthday and had a wonderful time. our waiter was outstanding and really went beyond the call of duty when he graciously helped my 90 year old mother get to the meat in her king crab legs. wow! and he was busy but made us all feel it was the thing he most wanted to do in between zooming around the restaurant. the noise level is always too high for me,i like to talk and not shout but that is part of the experience. the food is outstanding and we really had a fun night."
2015-11-13,WestportWill,4.0,"legal sea foods is a favorite, and i'll keep coming back!  the service and the food were tremendous, and we had a great time.  the only, and i repeat only, issue was a wine on the after-dinner list that should not have been."
2015-11-12,DecliningQuality,3.0,"i returned to legal (natick) after a disappointing experience at the boston legal courtesy of a gift cert proved because of the poor experience by legal corp. natick was better, but portions have shrunk, prices have risen & not enough vegetable choices.  and too noisy. employees professional, friendly and helpful though."
2015-11-08,Carol,5.0,"the trout special was prepared in an unusual way, with tomatoes, artichokes and crisp kale.  it was outstandingly delicious and looked very attractive on the plate."
2015-11-07,Friendtofriend,5.0,one thing we can always count on is the freshness of our entrees. the oysters are always fresh and delicious! this time we shared wellfleet and merry oysters as our appetizers. thank you legal seafoods!
2015-11-06,HoustonFoodLover,5.0,"every time i'm in a city that has a boston sea foods, i make it a point to eat there - at least once and, hopefully, more. this time was no exception. i was in natick on business and the first night there ordered take out crab cake combo - a delicious crab cake, 4 grilled shrimp and 4 grilled scallops. heaven. two nights later, back again with a group and i ordered the same thing (i can't remember when i ordered anything different!) along with fried clams for the table. the clams are really, really good - anyone remember howard johnson's fried clams that came in a roll or a bucket? well, legal's are even better. and their warm  sourdough rolls are scrumptious!"
2015-11-06,ShirinF,5.0,seafood casserole was very tasty. prosecco was also very good. very enjoyable as always
2015-11-05,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"really good food.  we shared the bison burger, kale salad, and chips and dip.  all very very good.  this was probably the best kale salad i've eaten (usually not a fan) - simple, yet very tasty."
2015-11-02,Terri,2.0,"i am a frequent dinner at legal seafood in framingham. unfortunately, our visit last sunday was far from perfect. the food was not hot. our server was inattentive and the service was extraordinarily slow. in addition, one of the meals was not served with the side dishes that were ordered."
2015-11-01,KSuzanne,5.0,"legal seafood is a favorite with us.  the waitstaff are well-trained, always friendly, polite, and efficient. the food is consistently good. at the framingham restaurant, the dining room can be noisy on some nights, but that is variable.  on our most recent visit, our waitress angie was fabulous. she was cheerful and very competent. it was a pleasure interacting with her. our food was delivered exactly as we ordered and was delicious. one of my favorite dishes is the ""nutty salmon,"" with slivered almonds on top, scrumptious mushroom raviolis, and spinach. another favorite of mine is the ""shrimp & garlic with pasta."" my husband loves the ""char grilled rainbow trout."" my daughter is a big fan of the ""fish chowder"" appetizer, which she frequently orders as her main course. one of legal's newest dishes is ""bang bang cauliflower."" this slightly spicy appetizer has been a huge hit with us. legal's also has an exellent takeout menu which we have used quite often. make sure to give them 30 - 40 minutes notice for your takeout order. this is not fast food. bon appetit!"
2015-10-31,PegC,4.0,i had grilled salmon and broccoli which was excellent. the salmon was cooked perfectly and the broccoli was not overcooked like you find in many restaurants.
2015-10-31,phyllisp,5.0,"our waitress, amber, was terrific leaving us time to talk with friends but always checking on us. she recommended a moderately priced red wine on their month's special list which we loved. the food was excellent. our high table in the bar section was fun. i had requested a high table and it was ready when we got there. it couldn't have been a better evening."
2015-10-29,PattyP,4.0,"we tried the crispy fried scallops, fried clams, fried oysters, fresh littleneck clams and oysters which were a special at $1 each - everything was delicious and it was great to share everything. of course, you have to have a cup of legal's white clam chowder with everything. delicious meal as always."
2015-10-26,Guest,5.0,i've been to this restaurant five times in 2015. i found the service to be pretty good to start with and it is getting better and more refined every time. the food was also carefully prepared and really good as i would expect of legal sea foods.
2015-10-25,WalthamiteFoodie,5.0,legal sea food is always reliably good.  we particularly like the lounge in framingham. love the ambiance and the raw bar in particular.
2015-10-24,Jimbo,4.0,"we love this legal sea foods- the food and service are always great.
we had 2 people in our party that have difficulty hearing.  after being seated at a loud table (near the kitchen) we asked to be relocated.  the manager (anthony) took care of us, moved us to another table with no fuss.  much quieter and made our night out a success!
thank you anthony!"
2015-10-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we always know what to expect from legal (truly fresh fish well-prepared) and they did not disappoint.  very nice and genuine waiter also helped, as did the gratis chocolate cake for desert!  not a budget restaurant by any means, but well worth it.  seems like they have improved the inside a bit from what we remember of last times--maybe the tables are further from each other??  they also did a good job of getting us in at our reservation time and getting us out in time to make a movie."
2015-10-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we always love to go to legal seafood, but for some reason they could not give me what i have been having for over the last year!!  they offered extra, but i was too full and brought leftovers home for my kitty.
inconsistent.  but we will return."
2015-10-22,jsands222,5.0,one think that can make or break a dining experience is the service. our waiter patrick was exceptional. the food was great also.
2015-10-22,Ballou,5.0,i hold a lot of brief business meetings at this restaurant. they are very supportive of my needs-quiet booth (if available) with a patient server. food is always great. lunch is very affordable. i strongly recommend legal in framingham---dinner is great as well.
2015-10-16,twinjules,4.0,"delicious dinner out. my husband enjoyed his salmon dish, and i really loved my shrimp garlic over homemade pasta. 
our cocktails were spot on and wedge salads were superb.
the only fault i did find was that the oysters had a bit of shell in them."
2015-10-14,Dave,4.0,"excellent seafood and efficient service by waiters who sincerely care about providing a nice dining experience, all in an environment conducive to conversation and good cheer."
2015-10-12,TripAdvisor,4.0,"love legal.  perhaps the top spot for dining in the area.  love the shrimp cocktail, crabcakes, salads, lobsters, scallops... good sides.  professional service and attitude.  good wine list, fairly priced."
2015-10-11,booboo,2.0,the oyster special was not offered on sunday although they advertised it for october.   it took over 50 min for dinner to be served!  3 out of 5 of us order dinners and the other 2 had soup.  lobster bisque was delicious and clam chowder a disappointment.  fried clams were good but portion of onion strings under the clams was skimpy.   mai tai was weak barely seeing dark rum in drink.  will not go back.  not worth the price or long wait.
2015-10-09,Crabby9,4.0,unable to make original reservation time. legal accommodated and gave us a later slot. seating was prompt and so was service. both entrees were very good. they and the appetizers were served with plenty of hot towels for cleanup. we didn't want dessert afterward and the wait staff didn't push the issue and presented our check after wishing us a good night.
2015-10-08,TonyBoston,5.0,"hosted a family dinner of 9 on thursday night.  great food and friendly service.  fun vibe.  total cost was $51/person (all in), including one kid"
2015-10-04,Shermy48,5.0,everything was perfect the service was great and the food even better!!
2015-10-02,PK8832,4.0,"nice food, good service, but lack of ambience... but all good"
2015-09-30,Along4ride,3.0,"we made a reservation for 7:15 but we weren't seated until almost 8pm. then the service was slow in getting our orders and food. it ended up being longer than it should have been which was frustrating since we were with our parents/in laws and they were getting tired. usually it goes much better at legal's but this night was not the best. they did try to make it up by giving us some free appetizers and/or free premium sides, which we ended up getting. but when the bill came we were charged for the premium sides. we just paid the bill with them being charged because by that time, we just wanted to go home. everyone was tired and needed to get into bed. the manager  tried to catch us before we left to fix the situation, literally coming out to the car to stop us and say she would re-do the bill, but we were already buckled into the car and ready to leave, so we just said forget it and went home. it was nice of her to try, but it should not have come to that."
2015-09-26,Mmmm,5.0,great experience.  only complaint is that the waitress seemed to be rushing us out at the end of the meal.  she handed us the check before we even started with dessert.
2015-09-26,5eagle20,5.0,"legal sea foods is a boston institution.  the framingham location lives up to its namesake.  atmosphere is a great mix between upscale and casual.  the main dining room can get a bit loud, but the secondary room is very intimate.  for appetizers, we ordered three oyster scampi, which are oysters topping with small shrimp and cheese, and baked.  they were a great start to the meal.  

for an entree, i ordered the seafood casserole, which is a combination of scallops, shrimp, and cod baked together in a garlic sherry sauce topped with bread crumbs.  the dish is a great mix of flavors and is not drowned in the sauce, so you can taste the quality of the ingredients.  another member of our table ordered the fried clams.  again, the breading of the clams was light and didn't mask the great flavor of them.  the dish of note this evening, however, was the grilled swordfish, topped with roasted peppers and a balsamic reduction.  the presentation was outstanding; it was colorful and jumped off the plate.  the taste was even better as the reduction gave a sharp contrast to the richness of the fish.

no dinner is complete without dessert, for which i had the cheesecake topped with raspberry puree.  the cheesecake was both light and rich, a rare combination, and the raspberries did not overwhelm the dish, which is also rare.  i was pleasantly surprised, since legal is not necessarily known for their dessert.

our server seemed a bit absent-minded at times, but was nice enough and fairly knowledgable about the menu.  still, this was an outstanding dinner, which is what i've come to expect from any legal sea foods."
2015-09-22,austinone,5.0,again never a less than stellar menu and food selections.   this place never gets old and always is the top of seafood.  brought a few friends and we had to have it all to the point of taking some home.
2015-09-20,Jem248,4.0,"i've never had a bad meal here. fresh food, excellent clam chowder, very nice."
2015-09-18,PegC,4.0,we had a party of 6 and our waiter was very attentive and helpful with ordering. the food was very good especially the gazpacho and the clam chowder.
2015-09-16,jarjeanne,5.0,"ls is so darned big, yet the plate is perfect--great salmon, and they will serve rare.  this is so much more than a ne fish place--reallly good food."
2015-09-16,needhamite,4.0,"legals is consistently good food. the portons are a little small, but very tasty."
2015-09-16,shimmysherry,3.0,"lunch is usually great at legal. however, i tried the fish tacos for the first time. very disappointing. the tacos were dry, with just a bit of mayo in the taco. between being too dry and not tasty enough, we knew we should have ordered the crabcakes. a sure thing. we waited for more sauce, or anything, to help moisten our tacos!! once our waiter finally brought over some chipotle mayo, it helped. by then, our food had cooled down too much. we drank our wine and left.  i plan on calling and letting the manager know this."
2015-09-15,NYDiner,5.0,"legal lives up to its reputation.  after many visits it does not disappoint.  my medium sized lobster (stuffed with shrimp and scallops) was excellent.  my wife's small broiled lobster still had a lot meat and was perfectly cooked.  with two sides included, the meal was complete and satisfying.  the service was helpful and attentive without being intrusive."
2015-09-15,Pluto,3.0,"lobster dinner for 1.25-1.50 cost $34.95.  captain marden's cost for same is $19.95 - $21.95.
market basket selling live lobsters at $4.99/lb.

when cost of lobster drops dramatically, legal keeps prices very high."
2015-09-15,mhansen,5.0,"this has been my favorite restaurant for many years and it never disappoints.  recently i began eating a no salt & no fat diet and legal is the one restaurant that will grill the fish ""dry"" (without oil), rinse the salt off of the baked potato before cooking it and serve vegetables steamed without oil or butter or salt.  most restaurants cannot do this.  i have had almost everything on the menu and my favorites are anna's scrod, grilled shrimp or salmon or scallops and the key lime pie for dessert.  the service is always superb."
2015-09-14,Pass,4.0,our waiter was flexible and took care of us as we figured out what we wanted to have.  very helpful.
2015-09-12,Wzaza,5.0,"scott,i think that was his name was the best wait person i have had.  he deserves a raise!!!!"
2015-09-12,Jean,3.0,love the fried clams and fresh broiled fish with rice and veg. crowded and noisy.
2015-09-12,Carol,5.0,"legal sea foods is at the top of my list of favorite restaurants.  the food is excellent and if ever something misses, the restaurant always takes care to correct it."
2015-09-11,Friendtofriend,5.0,we have dined at many of the legal seafood restaurants  since the early 70's and have never been disappointed. the oysters and main meal were excellent. a wonderful place to meet up with good friends!
2015-09-10,Potsy999,5.0,"my wife and i brought a couple visiting from out of town, who were looking for a true new england lobster experience, and that's just what they got!  we got a table in the bar so we could watch the beginning of the patriots game and shared two great apps: rhode island style calimari & the bang bang cauliflower.  my friends, who know their wines, picked out a spanish red, avante, that paired well with the evening's selections.  our server's timing was super throughout the evening, including the delivery of our to go order of more cauliflower!  each of our meals were cooked just right along with some wonderful sides.  overall  an outstanding dinner!  ;~}"
2015-09-05,RMCdW,3.0,legal sea food has become overpriced for the quality of food it serves. though we had a reservation we were asked to wait with a malfunctioning beeper for a table to come available. the wait staff was slow and discourteous. the food was average and certainly not meriting the price. i'm happy to pay when the food and service are commensurate with the quality of the experience.
2015-09-04,Cheryl,5.0,"each and every time, without fail, we have found the legal seafoods in natick/framingham to be outstanding.  we are never disappointed, either with the food, the waitstaff, nor it's availability as to it's location.  we only recently moved back from san diego (we wish you were out there), but every time we return to framingham - legal seafoods is our first destination.

now that we are back, we'll be going more often, for nothing compares to it!"
2015-09-04,Jace1,4.0,"although this legal is due for a cosmetic makeover, i would feel the loss of this, one of the most consistent, legals.  the grille is handled impeccably, on this visit for my rainbow trout and my wife's scallops, the latter as a generous portion on a salad with plentiful crisp romaine. a side order of asparagus was perfection.  a dessert, a special on that night, was a tasty lemon custard  with fruit; a refreshing finish for the evening.  service is usually good here, but on this evening was outstanding.  i only regret that we didn't get our waiter's name so that we could ask for him again."
2015-09-04,Warren,2.0,"i have long believed that one should only eat seafood directly at the coast and my experience with the fried clams dish at the framingham branch of legal seafood would support this. mine were mushy, soft, and tasted like a warmed over prepared meal of fried clams from ""meals on wheels"". fried clams should be very fresh, fried in very hot fat or oil with a light batter that becomes crisp, and slightly crunchy. many customers ordered this meal on this evening and without knowing how clams should taste when properly prepared would have gone home with a negative attitude about this wonderful dish. that legal seafoods knows better is evident when one orders this dish at legal harborside. my wife's casserole of shrimp and  crab was equally disappointing consisting of too much bread and minimal evidence of crab"
2015-08-30,HighExpectations,3.0,"we were greeted warmly and received a table which we had described - quiet/romantic. our server came over promptly: with no introduction; no smile; in a peremptory manner; did his best to mechanically taker orders. delivered monosyllabic answers to our requests with an occasional grunt and some tedious response. kale side dish with vanilla and peanuts was almost palatable. the salmon (faroes) and swordfish were quite tasty,  yet such a small serving, not worth the price.
mashed potato and baked potato were hard to destroy. 
overall a disappointing experience for a birthday celebration and not worth the $80+ price tag. i spoke to the manager in charge and received a tepid response and felt the waiter was a known negative long before our experience. will not take another chance in framingham - bush league."
2015-08-29,Lindsay,4.0,"legal seafoods is wonderful for great and fresh seafood .... clam chowder, lobster, shrimp, scrod and fish and chips. mussels and salads also great."
2015-08-29,marbru,5.0,"our family has lots of 'special eaters' and the gluten free menu and willingness of  the very knowledgeable staff helped us all enjoy our meal without worrying about any 'surprises'!  it is always a treat to celebrate occasions - big and small - with the great menu, delicious and fresh dishes and attentive service.  we'll be back  soon, i hope!"
2015-08-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"brought family from out of town. very pleased with our experience, the food was fabulous at a reasonable price."
2015-08-28,Foodie,2.0,"visiting boston for the first time, i was hoping to try some good quality of seafood.  i chose legal seafood thinking that they had a good reputation.  the lobster bake i ordered was a total disappointment.  lobster bake came with steamed lobster, clams, mussels, sausage and corn.  the food was cold, clams were full of sands, the corn was over cooked and the sausage was tough.  despite of the quality of food, the service was good."
2015-08-26,OpenTable Diner,4.0,really appreciated that they can cater to people with dietary restrictions. staff were extremely helpful about customizing entree to meet low-salt requirement. only thing that would improve dining experience would be a lower noise level.
2015-08-25,TripAdvisor,4.0,"another fine meal at legal.  shrimp cocktail (the best anywhere), chowder.  hadn't had fried scallops in years and was in the mood for a change of pace... they are very good here.  enjoyed our meal... service uncharacteristically a little off."
2015-08-22,John,4.0,"excellent food and good service, although could be a little more attentive, not because the server as not good, but because it appears that the servers are overworked, rushing to keep many patrons happy.
also, the air conditioning was on and the overhead fans were also running, sending a blast of cold air to our table.  it was uncomfortable, but we did not complain because we realized that the management could not turn off the cooling to suit us.  we are elderly and realize that we feel  colder than young people do, but there were numerous older people there who must also have felt uncomfortable.   a little moderation in the cooling could have helped."
2015-08-14,BostonBabs,3.0,good food; nice atmosphere. our waitress took good care of us.
2015-08-02,EnjoyEating,3.0,"the food was great, but the service could have been faster and better organized."
2015-08-02,Likes,3.0,"ordered spicy fish and chips, fish was not spicy, just salty. fish came in 3 small pieces, first piece was ok, but the last two which were smaller were dried and overcooked. it was terrible. expected much better from this type of restaurant. maybe i just ordered the wrong dish. my wife had combo plate with crab cakes, shrimp and scallops, grilled, she said it was not bad. had fish chowder, which was passable, and an order of fried oysters, small portions, tasted good, but not much food. overall the fish and chips being over done really ruined the experience. otherwise, not bad."
2015-07-31,jvd1,5.0,"this is a perennial favorite among local restaurants in framingham/antics area. excellent seafood, great wine and special deserts."
2015-07-28,Luv2doWIne,4.0,"excellent meal here with my sister when i arrived in boston.  fresh seafood and delicious clam chowder, you really can't go wrong.  prices are high but if you want a true new england seafood meal this is the place to go!  make reservations as it gets busy in the evenings.  will be returning...highly recommend :)"
2015-07-17,May10,3.0,"hadn't been here in awhile because last time i was here i did not have a good meal.   however decided to give it another try.  was with 4 people for dinner.  servers were terrific and attentive.
i had grilled shrimp, baked potato, and onion strings.  fine but nothing great.  no particular presentation of food.   onion strings were lukewarm/shrimp and potato were hot.  friend had fried shrimp and wound up eating some of my grilled shrimp.  said her shrimp were overcooked and tough and she should have sent them back.
crabcake person and salmon person were happy.  wine prices are high for a glass of wine.  entree prices are on the high side too.  i have  a local fish market/restaurant that  i like better than here.   don't think i would return here for dinner.
noise level was lively and we had a screaming child in our area but this seems to be the norm at most restaurants lately."
2015-07-16,EatonWright,3.0,a good chain experience.
2015-07-15,Kornerman,2.0,"i had scallops, which were ""dry packed"" but not very tasty.  service was slow, very slow but the manager did reassure us the food would be coming shortly.  not sure i will return."
2015-07-12,OpenTable Diner,4.0,everyone was helpful and attentive.  the atmosphere was a little busy.  i felt like i was in a maze with the high walls.
2015-07-11,PamZahn,4.0,"lots of kids running loose and allowed to stand up on booth seats and yell over to the next booth.  no parental control, but no waitstaff control either."
2015-07-10,picky,3.0,"i had loved the lobster roll last week & returned for more. it was saturday nite & the bar was full but moving. 
server was inattentive. no one asked how good was after serving. i had to send back onion rings & broccoli as it was quite cold. lobster roll was toasted but also cool. but i kept it. the roll seemed  less filled & the lobster roll not as tasty. not the best experience for a $28 lobster roll. 
wedge salad was good. i like more dressing. friends shrimp broccoli & rice & cheese was good. hot. 
in general i like legals. but not so much that nite."
2015-07-08,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"every legal seafoods restaurant is different in layout and scenery, but the food is always consistently great!  the chowder and baked scrod is the best i have had!  this location is no exception!!"
2015-07-05,picky,4.0,"i ordered kumamato oysters. they were out so i took suggestion of kitchen/waitress. not the same. however the waitress was really good & tried hard. had a lobster roll for about $28. all the time we
hike i waited i was regretting the choice as silly. good lobster rolls are available this time of year for 1/2 the price. this was the best lobster salad and great roll ever! 
my partner had a 3 fish ( tuna sword & halibut) plus shrimp onion rings etc. very good. 
we sat in the bar on a late sunday nite & it was pleasant. 
rolls are irresistible."
2015-07-04,JLCB,3.0,"the scallops, shrimp and crabcake were good but the salad greens were wilted and lacked dressing."
2015-06-26,MichaelT,5.0,staff was pleasant and professional. food was fantastic!
2015-06-23,PattyP,5.0,"so many fresh seafood options to choose from. we ordered the fresh cherrystone clams which were so briny and perfectly shucked, as well as the famous legal's clam chowder - the best i've ever eaten.
the fish tacos are a delight - moist fish with crunchy cabbage and creamy avocado and crema, and the key lime pie is outstanding"
2015-06-23,Henri,3.0,"the food was fine; the service was a bit over the top in terms of treating us like it was five-star dining, which it isn't. and our waiter tended to push the desserts a little too hard. (we didn't, er, bite.)"
2015-06-22,Carol,5.0,"our group enjoyed ne clam chowder, crab cake, artic char with polenta and house salad, king crab legs, and key lime pie.  as usual, everything was excellent!"

2015-06-13,Delish,5.0,"with the size and reputation of this restaurant, i expected good food, but slow service. well, the food was awesome - fresh, fresh bluefish you don't find anywhere - and the service with our waitress, jen, was fantastic!! still and always a great choice of restaurant."
2015-06-02,Julie,3.0,"i ordered the shrimp and garlic and the dish was pretty dry. the pasta was dry and crusty and the shrimp was a bit overcooked. my nephew was deciding between two dishes and went with the recommendation of the server. he was not that thrilled with his choice. essentially it was just a piece of salmon on a bed of lettuce. i was pretty disappointed on this particular night with the quality of the food. i've had better meals at this restaurant before. on the other hand, the service was excellent and everyone was very friendly."
2015-05-30,Nana4,4.0,"consistently good food always cooked to perfection. presentation could stand improvement.
wait staff is excellent."
2015-05-30,Spicegirl,5.0,"expensive dinner for a stop in a strip mall type location.  chowder was delicious but  the rest of the meal was  pretty ordinary, but pricey."
2015-05-25,Robbie,4.0,"always fresh seafood, and good service.  nice ambiance.  excellent oysters and martinis.  consistently the best seafood in boston. very nice decor, in a quiet, well designed setting.  one of our real favorites for a pleasant, and very  comfortable meal out."
2015-05-20,JuliaW,5.0,never had a bad experience or problem with my meal - they are very consistent in the quality of the food.
2015-05-20,Debi,5.0,"eat here often and enjoy the seafood, the service and the great wine.  we eat here often and the seafood is always top-notch.  if you are looking for a great seafood restaurant in framingham, this is the place to go. my favorites on the appetizers are the steamers and kon-pao cauliflower and my favorite meals are the fried clams, lobster roll, jasmine shrimp, and sole piccata.  my husband loves the lobster bisque as well as their fish specials.  great place for lunch or dinner."
2015-05-19,JoyG,4.0,loved my lunch as always!!  my our of state guests were very happy with their choices!!
2015-05-17,SundayDine,2.0,we were there for a celebration.  had made a reservation.  we were in a side room and at a table near the wall.  my mom and husband both have hearing loss and wear hearing aids.  the noise level was sooooooooo high it was agitating even for me with normal hearing.  it made dinner conversation impossible.  the evening was ruined from the moment we sat down.  it was clear that everyone was having difficulty hearing each other because the level of conversation at other tables was so high i could hear their conversations better than what was at my own.  not an enjoyable dining experience at all!!
2015-05-17,mlemx,5.0,"the food was excellent-from apps to dessert.  
two issues that need attention. our waiter must have been new. we received desserts but had to sit and wait for silverware for several minutes. very challenging when desserts look  so good.  guests received their coffees but no cream and sugar. sit and wait.  cream arrived but sugar never did. 
also, we had two people at our table with hearing aids. they could not hear anything because of the noise level of the table beside us. two different sets of diners and noise level was still a problem. one of our guests literally sat and watched us while she ate because the room was too noisy. we may not return for our annual brunch because of this. hopefully there is a quieter area of the restaurant."
2015-05-15,PaulA,5.0,best oysters ever!  lobster was maine bardshell and excellent.  i'm going back for lunch asap.
2015-05-13,Approve,4.0,"i was shocked when i got my bill to see the price i paid for wild salmon.  i dine here all of the time and when they didn't have what i wanted, i asked if they had wild salmon and ordered it.  talk about sticker shock when the bill was brought!  wow!  and the portion was very small as well.  they said it was 8 oz. but it didn't look like 8 oz."
2015-05-12,TripAdvisor,4.0,"excellent meal again tonight.  clam chowder, lobsters, jasmine special (shrimp), nice sides... bottle of sonoma cutrer chardonnay.  service was exceptional tonight... early tuesday night and wasn't packed."
2015-05-10,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we had a very good waitress and the food was delicious.  it was difficult to hear our waitress due to the noise level.
2015-05-03,Lanie,5.0,the fish is always fresh and cooked perfectly. service is great. you can't go wrong here.
2015-04-30,MammaD,4.0,did not care for the sauted kale and it should have been taken off the bill.
2015-04-28,E2013,5.0,"i really enjoyed my dinner this tuesday night. the service was super friendly and very accommodating to all requests (they even noticed i looked cold, and turned down the fans, nice!). i liked that we weren't bothered too often and we weren't rushed. i enjoyed the food immensely. extremely fresh tasting fish and all was cooked to perfection."
2015-04-25,Carolyn,5.0,"had a 7pm reservation on a sat night,  2 of our party were running late, but they seated us right away anyway so we did not lose the table ,  a nice surprise since most restaurants will not seat you until the whole party is present , and they were busy !    our server was outstanding,  helpful , pleasant, and engaging without making us feel rushed  at all.   cocktails were all nicely made.    now the food ,  we ordered smoked salmon and a small basket of fried clams for apps ,  both were very tasty .    dinner  - king crab,  crab cakes,  medley, and seafood casserole, all very good, and then we split  2 desserts, and had coffee.    overall, it's a nice restaurant, we went all out  so it was a very expensive evening , but you can also get away with a nice app & a cup a chowder for a reasonable priced dinner out."
2015-04-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great food! can't go wrong at legals. heads up though, it is loud."
2015-04-20,RTMa,2.0,we come here all the time and this time was a disappointment. good took over 30 minutes to get and my grilled chicken was flavorless and tasted old. won't be going back any time soon.
2015-04-18,DownhillBill56,4.0,"a family dinner and we all enjoyed our meals - lobster, grilled assortment, fish and chips and whole clams, ne clam chowder, oysters - all tasty. service was very good. the restaurant was busy but not too loud and we didn't feel rushed. don't miss their version of boston cream pie."
2015-04-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"i had made reservation for 5 and 8 people came
they were able to take care of us
waiter was professional  and pleasant
and a wonderful experience was had by all ."
2015-04-17,OnlyVisitingThisPlanet,4.0,"this place was crowded on friday night the weekend before the boston marathon, but we had a reservation, and didn't have to wait very long. excellent food, wine and service. our server was very charming and attentive. the seafood casserole and grilled tuna were prepared just right. very noisy place though, so conversation was challenging. we were seated on the ""main drag"" and there was heavy customer and wait staff traffic, which was a bit distracting. a table in a corner would be ideal next time. a little on the pricey side, but the portions are generous."
2015-04-09,J825,3.0,food is always good & waitress was good but it took over 45 minutes.  to get our food ! that is unacceptable.
2015-04-08,sukoshi,5.0,we often go here for date nights and other special dinners when family and friends come to visit. food is always wonderful!
2015-04-07,BillW,3.0,took a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen.  everything else was good.  waiters very attentive.
2015-04-06,Judy,5.0,"we'd asked for a quiet table that we could use for a good long visit.  family rendezvoused from ma, ct, and wi.  terrific server really let us take our time, yet was appropriately attentive.  just the spot for seafood that we craved for this particular visit."
2015-04-05,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my parents say burlington location is 5 stars!!!
however we had a nice meal on easter."
2015-04-04,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"while all the food was nicely cooked and presented, almost everything had a bitter flavor and aftertaste putting off the whole group.  the waitress was overloaded so we left waiting or she would forget items . we have been here before when the service and food were better - not sure what happened this time. but it will be a while before we return."
2015-04-04,Danl,2.0,just not up to other leagal seafoods i been to in other locations.  nothing more than a fast food experience.
2015-03-28,Eattoomuch,4.0,service usually good. hostess can be more pleasant.  food is predictable and good.
2015-03-27,TripAdvisor,4.0,"very busy, place was packed.  still fine service and timing of the kitchen.  excellent shrimp cocktail and clam chowder as usual.   really nice mild fish dish with a mustard crust... a special.  steamed lobster, perfect."
2015-03-22,Dinger,4.0,"i had sword fish, perfect, calamari, perfect, service perfect. they do get big $$$ for their portions otherwise i would have been 5 star all the way."
2015-03-21,picky,4.0,"we go to the framingham legals regularly.  the industrial look is getting old and its noisy.

they were out of 2 of 5 types of oysters (listed on the daily special).& 2 types of fish at only 6:45.

my trout as baked with panko crumbs, very light and delicious.with a little feta(?) . partner liked his sole stuffed. side of mash potato with flavors was great. side of ""risotto"" with mushrooms was really only normal rice. but tasty. 
i had 4 very very very tiny washington oysters. i eat these all  the time and know they are small and sweet but these were tiny. but good. nicely served with choice of 2 sauces (a red spicy with horseradish and a garlic oil base; also 2 types of bottled hot sauce were put out.
 bread is always good.
service was terrific!"
2015-03-14,JoshC,5.0,"our food was great, the kids had a good time (and ate their dinner) and we were able to secure our favorite server, sonya. really just a wonderful evening for my birthday dinner. a+"

2015-03-09,AnnF,5.0,great night celebrating friends' 50th birthdays!  our waitress was outstanding!  perfect amount of attention....great service and giving us the time to catch up.
2015-03-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"anyone coming to this restaurant for the first time must try the roasted mushrooms and the fried shrimp. the mushrooms were extremely flavorful..just an explosion of different spices in your mouth. the shrimp were so meaty until i wondered if i was eating prawns. i was told that they serve larger jumbo shrimp. you will definitely find it hard to finish all of the shrimp. 

i have been back to this restaurant twice in a week! enjoy!"
2015-03-09,frequentdiner,4.0,"we had a late lunch to celebrate our anniversary --- 2 people. the food was very good, as expected. the service not so good. after serving our waiter visited the table once. when we wanted extra rolls, we had to flag down another server."
2015-03-08,TripAdvisor,4.0,"simply fabulous shrimp cocktail w/excellent cocktail sauce.... my son always orders the crab cakes... had a nice lobster tonight with fresh vegetables (awesome roasted carrotts and the always great sugar snap peas).  splurged and we shared a boston creme pie... very good, not amazing.  
highly recommended"
2015-03-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,was very impressed with customer service. our table was not ready for reservation and we were seated about twenty minutes late. manager came over right way and apologized and brought a complimentary appetizer. we did not complain but there was still that extra effort to treat customers with class. it goes a long way in my book!
2015-03-03,formah,3.0,"it was fine; i enjoyed it, but there was no real ""wow"" factor. cole slaw was saltier, sweeter, creamier than i prefer, though the cabbage was fresh. grilled trout was fresh, if slightly overcooked. such a thin fish requires only 60 seconds or so of intense heat. it was also a bit on the salty side."
2015-02-28,sukoshi,4.0,"service was quick and the food was great. have never had a bad experience here, and it is always our go-to for date night!"
2015-02-28,Never2cook,5.0,"our server 'cookie' really made the dining experience so enjoyable.

2015-02-20,Peetie,5.0,"my wife and i were delighted with our 1st visit, and met out of state friends this time. all four of us were very pleased with our food and the service was excellent - there when wanted and not intruding on our getting together. fried clams, smoked salmon, arctic char, baked scrod all excellent. i chose a different appetizer and main course to my own 1st visit, just as good,  and i am looking forward to next time trying something else. i have been ***** happy each visit and love the coffee old fashioned cocktail as a pre dinner drink."
2015-02-20,MariaC,3.0,"the food was good however, the service was totally rushed. our main entrees came out way too early as we had just received the appetizer and salads! the waitress then came back and tried to remove our dinner plates before we were even finished.....not impressed at all."
2015-02-18,OnTheRocks,4.0,"been here many times! food... great as always. oysters super fresh! the service was a little slow, but very kind & friendly."

2015-02-14,Alan,5.0,"my wife & i had dinner reservations for 4 pm. however, due to a snow storm we arrived earlier and were seated immediately. my wife had the crab meat salad and i had a fried plate. we both enjoyed it. we also had beverages. my wife had wite zinfandel i had beer. our waitress was friendly and we were not rushed through our meals even though a crowd was waiting in the lobby. we sat at a booth in the bar."
2015-02-14,Candy,5.0,food was delicious but on the pricy side. for a special occasion it's wonderful. sdevice was good. we went for balentines day and we had the snow storm causing us to run a little late. but they still managed to get us in which was lovely.
2015-02-07,Dkauf46552,5.0,"we've been here many times and have never been disappointed.  as fish, but not seafood, lovers we are always impressed by the selection and creativity of fish entrees.  our server was attentive but not to the point of distraction.  she even noticed some bones on the side of my husband's plate and asked if he was ok.  i had pan fried salmon with almonds, mushroom ravioli, and sautéed spinach.  unusual and tasty.  my husband had grilled trout, and enjoyed. 

we made this reservation through opentable and requested a quiet table far from the kitchen and not on the main walkway.  we were pleasantly surprised that this request was accommodated.

great experience and will return."
2015-02-05,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the food was delicious and our server was so nice. lovely evening!

2015-01-10,Bestrestaurant,5.0,"i have yet to find a better place in and around boston for seafood.  the oysters to start were excellent. we all ordered an array from the calamari, fried seafood platter which was difficult to dent to the wood fired platter that was abundant with 5 types of fish!  excellent service in addition to a great meal."

2015-01-02,Disappointed7,3.0,"fried seafood trio was ridiculously small (3 of each), and frozen to boot. tuna steak was old and tough.  salad was wilted and the burger was like a fast food joint......all this for $200.   very disappointed as this was a gift certificate with the family.  
the only plus was the waitress who was beyond good !   thanks to her we still enjoyed ourselves."

2014-12-28,Mumsedso,4.0,"never disappoints - a bit pricey but the food is always fresh and reliably good.  servers and staff are very courteous and knowledgable about the menu options.  nice wine list.  overall, someplace one is proud to bring guests for a good meal and a staff that is unobtrusive"

2014-12-25,Leominster,5.0,"sergei  was our server and he got a 10 plus for his friendliness, thoughtfulness and attention. the food was served very hot and it was delicious to the last bite. we will be back!  thank you for feeding us on christmas day!"
2014-12-25,Yogagail,5.0,"having had a super disappointing experience at pf changs last week, checked their menu and they only have 2 gf/df items, legals was the complete opposite! the server already knew and pointed out the vast array of dishes i could have. they have yummy gf rolls. i highly recommend legals for anyone who has a gluten or dairy allergy."
2014-12-25,Gigi,4.0,the restaurant was great for a last minute christmas dinner.  they were very busy but the food was great and the service was good.  the seating was a little crowded and noisy but it felt good to see so many families around on such a great family day.

2014-12-09,SeaSalt,3.0,lsf is consistent but needs to be freshened up a bit.  seafood restaurants should never use carpeting as there will always be an unpleasant aura/odor upon entering.
2014-12-05,renheff,5.0,"we had a great night despite of - or rather because of one hiccup.  my husband ordered a tuna steak medium rare, and the kitchen accidentally overcooked it, but the mistake was caught before bringing it out; as a result our entrées were delayed.  they were very attentive to us, and made sure we were well taken care of as we waited.  as my husband ate it, sonya (our server) noticed  it was still slightly overdone, and insisted that they do something to make up for it.  they were willing bring out another tuna steak in addition to it, but my husband suggested the sashimi appetizer instead, which they were more than happy to do.  did i mention that while we waited for our entrees sonya taught our daughter how to make an origami rose out of a paper napkin?  she obviously takes great pride in her job, and it shows.   we'll definitely be back."
2014-12-01,JWLnGLL,4.0,"i've eaten at various lsf locations many times over the years, though this was the first time at the framingham location. everything was as expected, good food, good selection of drinks. service was very attentive and friendly, but perhaps overly so in this case."
2014-11-30,seastar,2.0,"i've eaten at legals for many years, and am never impressed.  oysters were 2.75 each, other meals were bland or too salty.  overall unimpressive."
2014-11-29,SallyB,5.0,best run restaurant around. food is consistently great. the best!
2014-11-27,Prissl,2.0,"yes, it was thanksgiving and it was clear our server would rather have been elsewhere. tuna was well-done, despite ordering it medium. and it was on a bed of refrigerator cold cous cous. the menu did not indicate the cous cous would be cold. i expected warm, however room temp would be fine. i gave never heard of putting a warm piece of fish on a cold side dish."

2014-11-23,TripAdvisor,4.0,stopped by for another excellent meal here.  was lucky they had bay scallops in the house... excellent sweet morsels of goodness... perfectly broiled.  recommend the clam chowder (classic) and the best shrimp cocktail around.  wine list always appreciated for the fair pricing.

2014-11-17,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"superb service! the food was not to the standard it should be, but the service more than made up for it."
2014-11-15,Angel,5.0,wonderful food and great service.  grilled salmon was cooked perfectly!angel
2014-11-08,FellShort,3.0,"you can certainly get a good meal here, but be prepared to pay for it - more than you'd expect to pay at another seafood restaurant."
2014-11-07,HopJim,3.0,"unless you are a tourist and don't know better, not the place for lobster and clams.  typically lukewarm with clambake having many mussels and few clams (also lukewarm).  fish better but overall not the restaurant it was 5+ years ago."
2014-11-02,deannajm,5.0,"not only were the food and service the best ever (as it always is), but the special attention given by the manager and wait staff was above and beyond! highly recommend!  we'll be back soon!"
2014-11-01,ctha,5.0,the food is always consistent and great if your a seafood eater. reservations is recommended cause this framingham location gets pack quickly.
2014-11-01,Dennyann,4.0,we had reservation but waited about 15 minutes for table. food was excellent as always but service was really slow.  table sat after us was waited on first. apps took a long time to come out but after that everything seemed to flow.  i thiink our waitress was a little overwhelmed.
2014-10-29,Lynne1030,5.0,"if you love seafood, this is one of the best places to go in the boston suburbs.  we went for lunch. i had the clam chowder (a favorite) and the crabcake entree.  it was wonderful!"
2014-10-26,Sundays,4.0,"we like this location in particular.  the service is good, the atmosphere is nice and the wait is usually reasonable since it's a large restaurant.  we also appreciate the variety of items on the menu, including interesting specials.  it's pricey, so we don't go often, but when we go, we always enjoy it.  be sure to tell your server what you do and don't like if you're not familiar with some of the entrees.  they're good at recommending seafood and sauces that you're likely to enjoy."
2014-10-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"they have never let us down, we go at least once a month"
2014-10-22,Dinger,5.0,"the last couple of times we went here it was honestly, just so, so. johanna was our server and it was over the top from there. the grilled mahi-mahi is amazing, my wife had a appletini thingie that tasted like a slice of apple pie in a glass! i a glad to see lsf turn it around at this location. we were never rushed and johanna was always there right on time. we really had a great time. we were also entertaining a corporate guy from home office and he was quite impressed."
2014-10-19,Travel4kidsBrasil,3.0,"the best kids menu ! heath food . fresh fish, vegetable and a fruit in the kids menu"

2014-10-16,MarnieB,5.0,legals did a great job of accommodating a party of 8 in their lounge during a pat's game.  they did a great job of making sure we were comfortable and service was very good.
2014-10-13,barbwpt,4.0,"our group of 4 had to wait a very long time for our food.  ther e were problems in the kitchen.  our server kept us updated and informed and apologized many times for the delay.  when our food came, it was very good and hot.  

the manager came over to apologize to us and we were not charged for dessert or coffee.  even though there were problems, the restaurant handled them well."
2014-10-13,CharlieJ,1.0,"food ordered for dinner very early in the evening on a slow monday was very, very slow in arriving and was delivered cold. replacements were provided but they too took a long while to arrive and was only slightly warmer. server apologized several times but appeared helpless to correct the situation."

2014-10-11,wdnmb,5.0,"all the seafood and the side dishes were delicious and fresh. especially the lobster roll was a big hit. we also had great service, as the server went out of her way to accommodate special requests. we had been here before, and we will come here again!"
2014-10-10,Firstvisit2021,1.0,"hostess sat us in the family section and then sat a party of 8 w/ 4 obnoxious children next to us, one child was immediately under my chair.  on the other side was a geriatric couple who yelled there entire conversation.  we asked to move and were placed next to the kitchen hearing every argument from the kitchen staff.  so much for our date night away from the kids.  food was ok, and waitress did fine.  not a fan, and very disappointed."
2014-10-09,Mike,4.0,"our table was available per my open table reservation right on time w/o waiting.  the appetizer was excellent assortment of oysters , the dinner, beverages were simply awesome. we had an extremely knowledgeable waiter who schooled us very well.  we somlly had a very nice meal👍"

2014-10-04,dinnerwithdad,5.0,we always have a great meal at legal seafood inn framingham.  my only complaint is the noise level.
2014-10-04,WeeklyDiner,5.0,"we were thrilled to get a booth for two at dinner hour. we were placed in a low traffic spot, plenty of space to spread out and got constant attention from the waitstaff. the food was awesome and we left full and happy."
2014-10-03,Susanne,5.0,"we made a reservation on a friday night, and we were seated immediately. the food was excellent. my friend had haddock, and i tried the flounder provencal - quite a treat. restaurant is a bit pricey, but we enjoyed treating ourselves."
2014-10-02,TripAdvisor,4.0,was in the mood for some lobster... steamed lobsters were served hot and perfectly cooked.  rounded off the meal with shrimp cocktail and some good sides.  everyone liked their meal.  was thinking that the physical plant could use some upgrading.  excellent choice for the area.
2014-10-02,Sonny,4.0,the seafood is the best in the boston area and is always outstanding
2014-10-02,herb,3.0,took 1/2 hour to get our lunch.  think the waiter forgot to put the order in or check on it.  once we asked him about it after 30 minutes. it came out almost right away with a few things missing.  was finally fixed.  not typical

2014-09-25,DateMan1234567890,3.0,carlos was amazing.  great person and great at his job.   best server that i had in a long time.  he deserves a huge raise.
2014-09-19,gitano,3.0,"second visit in two weeks in which we ordered steamed mussels. on the earlier visit, the mussels were so small that our complaint led to having our check adjusted for the price of them. on the latter visit, we asked the waiter if the mussels were better this time. he said yes and he would ask the cook to select the larger one for us. they were somewhat bigger but very sup-par and not what you would expect from legal. they should take them off the menu until they can get quality mussels. i would not order them again that is if we return soon."
2014-09-19,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"great service but for 29.99 tuna sides should be larger, they have decreased amount"
2014-09-19,JoshC,5.0,our server sonya was amazing. the food was great. we had a very nice time.
2014-09-18,Luv2Dine,3.0,"our party of eight came from all over the state for a special birthday celebration on thursday night...reservation was at 7:45. we were not seated until just after 8:30. the hostess tried her best with a couple of apps on the house, but it was uncomfortable and annoying, as their waiting area is not very big and we were a large party. the night's seating seemed poorly planned...there were multiple 5-6 person tables available when we arrived at 7:45, and a number of smaller groups sitting at tables that could accommodate 8+. oysters and scallops were excellent, sides were meh...polenta has a strange kick to it, and the seaweed salad came out completely frozen. will be back, but not for a large group special occasion."
2014-09-14,Easydiner,4.0,always reliable and very good seafood. we have brought house guests there often and everyone is pleased with the food. it is one of our favorite restaurants
2014-09-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"i made a reservation with several caveats to bring together 3 of my kids, a coupla of their kids, my wife and i.  i am a hp and asked for a convenient table...it was provided, service and food was excellent  and as a bonus they were very kind and helpful in serving a 7 layer nyc cake my daughter brought.  we plan to do this again"
2014-09-13,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"very reliable venue for business or family, lunch or dinner. consistent quality of service and food."
2014-09-13,theatereater,5.0,with each member of the group coming from different location we needed an easily accessible and convenient place to meet by car and the legal's in framingham was perfect. we had people who have special dietary needs and all of those were accommodated with care by the staff. everyone reported their food to be very tasty and well-prepared. the waiter was untiringly patient with our many questions and special orders and the length of time that we lingered.
2014-09-09,picky,3.0,"in general the food was good. however the dessert a chocolate pudding was ice in the middle. we sent it bach & received another. it was quite cool also but we just kept it. 
back room is very loud"
2014-09-08,Millers,4.0,"great seafood.. a tad pricey, but very consistent."
2014-09-07,Barbara,4.0,"why are americans so noisy in restaurants?   or, is it the structure of the facility that makes every sound reverberate?   if only legal sea foods were quieter i would enjoy it so much more."
2014-09-06,FoodGeneral,4.0,"the food is always consistent, and great flavorings....but the hostess staff was a bit rude when i arrived 10 min early for a 7:30 reservation and we didn't finally get seated until 8pm... clearly they were over-booked..... once we were seated however, the manager did come to our table and he made things right - this was very consistent with the quality i would expect from legal.  thanks for making it right!"
2014-09-06,MichaelT,5.0,we started with a shrimp cocktail and the thai mussels which were great - i had wood grilled swordfish my wife had the wood grilled scallops - both were outstanding / finished with there interpretation of boston creme pie which was excellent - wait staff was excellent - one of the better meals we have had recently
2014-09-05,Glorygirl,4.0,"you can still count on legal seafood for excellent, flavorful, well prepared food (especially seafood), however it would be nice if the service matched. i realize that friday nights are busy, and the kitchen may get backed up, but it shouldn't take the server ten minutes to return with waters after asking what we wanted to drink. it another long interval before he visited our table again to take orders. while he did check with the chef to see if we could get a particular fish grilled vs fried, we almost felt that it was an inconvenience for him to serve us. 
he didn't warmly greet us or smile once during our evening. he was ver robotic. i am glad i was with family (party of 3) and not hosting clients. for the price, service should be better"
2014-09-05,BostonBuff,5.0,"over the past few years we've noticed that the service at legal seafood has improved greatly. today, we consider it right at the top of the boston restaurant scene for attentive service. really well managed. and the food is great too! best place to bring business visitors for a great new england seafood experience. and one last thing, the gluten-free options are truly outstanding. we had a visitor with celiac disease and she was ecstatic about the experience."
2014-09-02,Chrisfromthecape,2.0,"this was our first time back since christmas day, which was riddled with problems.  thought that mid week we would have a better experience.  chowder, just wasn't the same as everyone knows legal used to be the standard that others were measured by.  it was thin and lacked the robust taste.  tasted like a bag of blount that had been ""doctored up"" with water sans the base.  we ordered the fried whole belly clams and the wood grilled shrimp.  the clams were not even mediocre.  there was more breading than clam and the clams had the consistency of being previously frozen.  the shrimp was delicious.  i think i had this last year in their test kitchen in the airport."
2014-08-31,Mike,5.0,brough dad thier for his 78th.  shrimp cocktail does not get better then legals.  also had the duxbury oysters which were delish although a bit gritty.  the baked stuffed lobster was incredible and is my new goto dish.  well done.
2014-08-23,bogartdad,5.0,"we went to legal because for me, it's legal or nothin'. my friend had never been to the east coast let alone legal seafood so i knew this was going to be a treat. our server cookie ( what a gem!) greeted up promptly, guided us through the menu and to what we were in the mood for with expert knowledge and an insiders guide..we were in perfect hands! my steamers were phenomenal...and his clam chowder was legal good! i had the swordfish and it was incredible while he had the calamari trio with the thai calamari being the outstanding selection. cookie told us so. oh, and don't forget to try the legal mai tai. as good as my uncle made me when he lived in hawaii. that's the highest praise i can give it. a perfect night!"
2014-08-23,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"legal seafood is very good with seafood.  just need to add more choices of mineral waters from the world.  they only provide local water, voss?, which is not that good.  otherwise all food are delicious."
2014-08-22,Grateful,5.0,my experience at legal seafood was fantastic.  i had a large party that included 3 kids under 10 and negotiating a surprise birthday cake at the end.  the waiter was amazing and the food delicious.  this is also a great place for people with food allergies.
2014-08-21,Abebabe,4.0,"accommodated my allergies very well, but did not accomodate my guest's request for no seasoning. appreciated that the manager provided a new correct meal for my guest and comped her meal."
2014-08-21,Fashiongirl,4.0,consistently good.  you know exactly what you are going to order.
2014-08-20,localguy,4.0,i had the haddock and my wife enjoyed the salmon. both dishes were delicious. one of my side dishes was creamed corn that was out of this world. they have a large selection of seafood on their menu. my guess is that anything you ordered would be very good. if we are in the area again we will return.
2014-08-16,TaraK,5.0,great gluten free menu safe place to eat knowledgeable and conscientious staff. great experience
2014-08-16,Vacationtime,5.0,everyone was so attentive...and it really made the entire dining experience exceptional.  food was wonderful.  we had the alaskan salmon special.
2014-08-16,JandJ,4.0,"nice spot, very busy, lots of noise. we had a very chatty server who was very pleasant. our special food (allergy issues) request was handled well. service was prompt. my grilled shrimp was very good but not hot. rest of the food was very good."
2014-08-15,Disappointed,3.0,"out of four group of 4 , 3 were satisfied, 1 was not. the fish chowder was quite bland and the quantity of scallops and shrimp with the salmon was very minimum for the price of $29.00. i don't think anything stood out above any other seafood restaurant."
2014-08-14,BGBashers,5.0,"dinner for six, including one under 12, two over 80 and another gluten-free. our server took special care to make sure all our gluten-free diner's needs were accommodated. (the gluten-free rolls were the best we've ever tasted.) food was hot and tasty, but the menu has been somewhat shortened since the last time i ate at legal's. very happy i was able to use opentable to make a reservation — be sure to do that and avoid the wait."
2014-08-13,flowerlady,4.0,"legal is one of our favorite spots to dine for both lunch and dinner.   the food is always outstanding.  it tends to be noisy, but not enough to keep us from going back.   i recommend the cioppino -- a nice variety of seafood in a tasty broth with a crunchy, garlicky piece of bread for dipping.   i ususally eat all the seafood and take home the rice mixed with the broth for a tasty lunch the next day."
2014-08-13,LoveThat,5.0,"thank you legal seafoods for consistency, dependability and delicious food! from chowders to crab dip, lobster rolls, grilled tuna, nutty salmon, jasmine shrimp, & baked cod, oh my goodness you just can't go wrong here. love legal seafoods!!! great waiters/waitresses, fresh delicious fish, usually perfectly cooked!! one of the best restaurants in framingham."
2014-08-11,loyal14,4.0,"i been eating at legal for over 20 years, not sure what's happened, i will go back but maybe they are taking success for granted?"
2014-08-09,Metrowestfoodie,2.0,"hadn't been to legal's in years. had never been impressed with it, but thought it was time to try again.  opinion was confirmed -- mediocre food at high prices.  clam chowder was not thick, and the clams were sandy.  main meal came cold and dry -- hardly any sauce on it, and scallops were sandy, crab cakes were mushy, and shrimp were small.  had to request dressing for salad, as it came with nothing on it.  husband's salmon was overcooked and also lacked sauce.  daughter's meal arrived cold.  service, however, was attentive and staff was knowledgeable about the menu and wines.  legal's has an amazing marketing program, because there is no way this restaurant deserves the reputation it has.  we will not be going back any time soon..."
2014-08-08,BostonBabs,4.0,i cook steamed clams at home on a regular basis.  i soak the clams in sink fulls of water peppered with oatmeal to draw out the sand.  the clams from leags are extremely clean and steamed to absolute perfection.  simply excellent.
2014-08-04,IronDuke68,3.0,we waited 90 minutes for our food.  the food was excellent.
2014-08-01,Shilohannie,5.0,"we celebrated our 44th anniversary at legal seafood and we had a wonderful time.  the waiter couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, the food was great and we had a nice spot for our table."

2014-07-31,frequentdiner,4.0,"i had lunch with 2 friends and we all ordered different entries and tasted each other's choices. the fish tacos were excellent, polenta side dish delicious and the seaweed side salad was also delicious. i had never tasted those sides before and will order them in the future. as always the fish was cooked to perfection and very fresh."
2014-07-30,TLC2,5.0,"my wife and i took my daughter and two grand daughters (ages 5 and 7).  our server, carlos, was wonderful from the moment he came to our table.  his suggestions were on the mark for wine and food.  he was able to get the manager to turn the a/c down because my granddaughters were freezing.  all and all a great experience.  know for their seafood, they had a full kid's menu as well.  my wife and daughter loved their steamed lobsters."
2014-07-29,Dan0,3.0,service was excellent and took no time getting seated even though they were busy.  the food was good but for the price not good enough. $30 for 2 crab cakes.  the sauce was good but very little of it.the crab cakes were basicly straight crab meat. everybody else at our table felt same about their meal.  good not great.  when you charge this much great is expected
2014-07-28,DanielT,5.0,very good! we enjoyed our dinner very much! asked for lobster roll ans got it even if not on menu! haddock was flaky and succulent!
2014-07-27,TGorham,5.0,this restaurant is consistently a great experience. the food is great and the manager in this venue treated us like royalty.
2014-07-25,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"caesar salad had no taste, calamari very oily - :( plus my white sangria was served in a water glass. the drink was 11.00 and think a better glass is warranted"
2014-07-23,Cdahl207,4.0,our family loves to come here for birthday or special occasions. perfect environment and amazing food! i love the oysters! biggest around!
2014-07-22,paulb,4.0,we have dined at legal many times and are always pleased with the quality of our meals and the service.  it's delivers a consistent and reliable experience every time.
2014-07-20,Foxylady,4.0,this is one of the best legal seafood restaurants around.  consistently good food and service.  we had the tuna and it was done just right.  very nice lunch.
2014-07-19,Henry,4.0,"legal was unusually empty on sat.--altho not surprising, since the local clientele likely were on the cape--planning their escapes for sun. food, as usual, was tasty--altho clam chowder could have used more---er---er---clams! french fries a bit dry, altho, paradoxically, a few outliers were soggy. trout not entirely bone-free. midtown nyc prices--beware!"
2014-07-18,Girl,4.0,"the chocolate cake is divine!!!  the service was excellent.  the salads are great.  fish, of course, is top notch!  i would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
2014-07-18,Cammech,5.0,my daughter took me to the legal seafood in framingham to celebrate my 50th birthday. i was really craving lobster and legals did not disappoint! our waitress was super friendly and helpful. (threw out my receipt so i can't remember her name. but really - she was wonderful!) her suggestions for cocktails and dessert were spot on! i was set up steamers for apps and lobster for dinner; my daughter got the ri-style calamari & swordfish. everything was cooked perfectly! as luck would have it - strawberry shortcake was the feautured dessert (one of my faves). staff even sung happy birthday to me! i've been bragging about this dinner to my friends. we've always loved legal's but hadn't been in awhile. will definitely been getting there more often
2014-07-15,Never2cook,5.0,excellent as always.
2014-07-13,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"we were a party of 4.  one entree was returned poorly prepared and poor quality swordfish to begin with.  2 persons' side dishes (the starch and the vegetable) arrived 9 minutes after the entree.

legal seafood used to be a terrific place.  perhaps it's just the staffing (out front and in the kitchen) at this particular location, who knows?  what we know is that we will not be returning any time soon."
2014-07-12,dinnerwithdad,4.0,"the food is always good, it came out quickly, service is good, what more could you want.  my only complaint is the noise level."
2014-07-04,Henry,4.0,"we dined on a rainy july 4, with most of the local clientele apparently away on their boats, albeit covered in rain gear. puzzling,  'we're out of clams,' by waitress at 7pm! food, as usual was top rate, although there were comments about legal's prices outperforming the s & p 500 by a large margin."
2014-07-03,BobT,5.0,"we met some friends for an early dinner at legal. it was the first time at this location. the inside is spacious and artfully decorated. we had reservations through open table and were seated right away. our waitress was very personable and always attentive to our needs. we ordered a variety of seafood dishes (crab cake combo, salmon, etc.). the food was beautifully presented and delicious. we stayed chatting for a while after the meal and the waitress good about not trying to hurry us out the door. i would recommend this restaurant without reservation."
2014-06-30,Icecreamlover,5.0,"we were having a very nice birthday dinner and the restaurant was busy. while we were waiting for dessert the manager i think came up to the table very apologetic about how slow the service had been,which we had not really noticed and took our desserts off the bill. wow that was a nice b-day treat:)"
2014-06-30,Diner1,5.0,"fresh, lively and a real treat. attentive service. great choice."
2014-06-27,Ellen,4.0,drinks great ~ wild sock eye salmon fabulous and a nice treat - could eat here every night. waitress as good as the food.
2014-06-27,Donnalb48,5.0,"lunch at legal seafoods was an enjoyable  experience. to begin with, i was pleased to be able to make a reservation so that i knew i had  a table. when we sat down to lunch, it was  too cool due to a fan overhead. the waitress helpfully turned the fan off  for us so that we weren't too cold  during our meal. i ordered the crab cakes. these were  some of the best i've had and included a nice salad.  we sat and chatted for a while after our meals  were completed and never felt rushed. i would recommend legal  seafoods for lunch."
2014-06-27,MtgMistress,4.0,"legal's is consistently good, no matter what time of the day."

2014-06-24,Hotels,4.0,"the food was outstanding, the host staff was outstanding, the server we had was not very good at all.  i was there for a client luncheon, we were in several conversations at the table and the server would come over, reach over my clients while we were talking, never an excuse me or may i take your plate.  felt very rushed.  

legal seafoods is a great chain and very consistent.  this was the choice of my client and she was very disappointed in the service as well."
2014-06-22,cleach8974,5.0,"when seafood dies and goes to heaven, this is what is eventually becomes...perfection.  i'm not a seafood kinda' guy, but i chose to take my wife there for her first stab at a whole lobster.  what an amazing culinary experience!  the lobster itself was nothing short of magical, and the seaweed salad and broccoli were every bit as good as the lobster (her words!).  i had the fish and chips, and i was very pleased with the quality of the fish and my side dishes.  omar, our waiter, actually helped my wife work all the angles on that lobster, and their hard work was rewarded when she had her first taste of the claw meat.  absolute perfection!  

overall, i would say it was an incredible dining experience."
2014-06-21,Mike,5.0,made reservations - sat right away when we arrived.  food was fantastic and cocktails were well done.

2014-06-20,Bostonfinner,4.0,"so glad to write this review. we are frequent diners who have been less frequent as things were ""slipping"" at this wonderful place. we had a great dinner (6 people) with each of us commenting on how well the meals were prepared. we all loved the bang bang cauliflower. summer cocktails and sangria are welcomed changes from the wine list. each dish was prepared as ordered and presented hot. chocolate layer cake and key lime desserts never disappoint."

2014-06-13,Snow,5.0,everyone loved their entrees and the appetizers were delicious as well. sergey was a very attentive waiter and gave some great recommendations for wine.
2014-06-13,coffeeisone,5.0,"i have never had a bad meal at this location!  the food and service were wonderful.  there are some fun starters, such as bang-bang cauliflower which is quite yummy.  my husband has food allergies and his meal was cooked perfectly."
2014-06-13,Foodlover,5.0,"we ordered grilled rainbow trout, we asked the cook to grill it for extra crispy skin and serve it skin side up as opposed
to down. legal always complied. good job and we appreciate it."
2014-06-13,OpenTable Diner,2.0,i went to dinner with my daughter and mother expecting a fabulous meal.  we ordered back stuffed shrimp which was suppossed to come out on two plates because we were splitting it and it did not. we sent it back and there were maybe four shrimp mostly sutffing without any crab as the menu implied. it was cold and the shrimp had an unusual flavor.  i had a seafood casserole which was average.  there was also maybe one piece of lobster. i am sad to say i will not be going back to legal seafood any time in the future and wouldn't recommend it to friends considering the high price and the disappointing meal.
2014-06-11,Luv2doWIne,4.0,great dinner here with my sister while visiting boston.  had a delicious shrimp dinner and their famous ne clam chowder.  great service and food quality.  not inexpensive but well worth the cost.  highly recommend.
2014-06-06,SamW,4.0,"great place to eat, is pretty noisy on a weekend evening, huge portions, great tastes."
2014-06-06,out2dine,5.0,"we've been to this location of legal seafoods several times this year and keep returning because the food and service is top notch.  this time we had a special occasion and knew we could really enjoy our meal.  the waitress gave us excellent service without being intruding.  the entrees are usually generous but we always can't pass up the clam chowder to start.  we tried the spanish wine sampler and really enjoyed the tasting.  the wood grill assortment is excellent and included shrimp, swordfish, tuna and salmon.  the asparagus was al dente and very thick.  the manager visited our table and was sincere in asking how our meal was. legals really knows how to satisfy their customers."
2014-06-04,Never2cook,5.0,topnotch service and foods.
2014-06-04,cupahjoe,4.0,"legals came through on another really tasty, quality seafood dinner. went there for a business meeting after work, and everyone enjoyed their meal. i had the soft shell crab in lemon caper butter sauce, and it was great! the service at legals has really seemed to improve over the last year or two, with almost everyone having a helpful, friendly demeanor. the one knock on our experience was that we were always waiting for our waiter -- the pacing was off the entire night. other than that, it was really good!"
2014-06-04,jeska,4.0,"a busy and pretty loud place. great food. everything we tried was delicious. crab cakes, calamari, fish, greens. all very good."
2014-06-03,bbmath,5.0,"boy, was my husband excited to be able to get gluten free fish and chips, but then started him off with fresh warm gluten free rolls, and they added in some onion rings with his french fries... he almost licked his plate clean... 


the service was excellent!!!!  very attentive, without being too much!

my scallops were generous and good (wood fired)."
2014-05-30,Potsy999,5.0,my wife and shared a great meal last friday night.  we were very pleased with the usual flexibility of menu.  i was allowed to order the parmesan encrusted soft shell crab as a main entry and it was amazing!  my wife ordered the generously sized kale side with the yogurt & peanuts separate.  the spanish wine recommended went quite well.  the service was wonderful throughout and we also observed our neighboring table treated quite well when a small mistake was made.
2014-05-24,Henry,4.0,"as usual--the best seafood in the area (and prices to match!!).
also as usual---reservation times are only approximate---and a 7:00 pm reservation turned into our being seated at 7:15. noise level equivalent to runway at logan international airport!"
2014-05-24,Disappointed,3.0,"the food was excellent, but the noise level was high... i would come back again."
2014-05-23,Renee,3.0,with a reservation we still had to wait 25 minutes.
2014-05-23,JudyW,4.0,"i have been going to legal seafood for years and have always been impressed with the freshness and quality of the food and never had bad service ever. in fact, the service has always been outstanding! this visit however, was the first time going once being diagnosed with celiac disease, and was bummed when i thought  i would have to give up ordering some of my favorite dishes. well, i couldn't have been more wrong!  i was very impressed with the variety of options available to me. fried clams w/ gluten free batter was delicious, as were the rolls that the waiter told me are freshly baked every time before serving...my seafood casserole was outstanding (topped with gluten-free breadcrumbs).  overall,   still impressed after all these years!"
2014-05-21,stanann,2.0,"was there for special occasion.  felt rushed thru the whole meal.  had made reservation, arrived on time, tipped great waiter well.  food was average (2 baked stuffed lobsters - $46 each - each had one piece of shrimp and 1 small scallop in the stuffing - rest ritz crackers.  manager walked by us more than 20 times with his tablet checking on the progress of our meal and when we would be leaving.  very distracting and not appreciated.  sent e-mail to legal about it, it is now day 6 without a response."
2014-05-18,Mumsedso,4.0,"food is consistently fresh & tasty here.i have always found the prices to be a bit on the high side,& portions a bit on the small side, but generally you will always receive a nice plate of food & very cordial waitstaff.i know how much fish costs per pound (even on the wholesale level where this establishment is buying)& $27 for wood grilled salmon with two sides seems over the top to me,unless they are giving you a 1/2 pound portion (which they are not)& two huge sides (which again,they are not).how much is a baked potato & a tiny (yes, tiny) serving of seaweed salad?just saying.  maybe they should consider throwing in a small house salad and a kind gesture.how much more could lettuce and a bit of dressing set them back?"
2014-05-18,Jboysmom,5.0,that's why we come to legal seafood.  the fish is always fresh and well prepared. it was very busy this weekend but that did not detract from our good time.  food and service were terrific.  we'll be back.
2014-05-17,SheldonZ,4.0,"service was outstanding.  our server was great - competent, friendly and attuned to our wishes -and he helped make this a great evening for us.

cherrystone clams were great. cioppino was well stocked with fish and shellfish, and came with a very good garlicky crusty bread.  soft shell crabs and shrimp stuffed with crab meat were both excellent.

desserts were bit disappointing.   the 'mixed berry tart' had  no fresh berries.  the boston cream pie had a thick layer of chocolate fudge on top which was too rich and too sweet to eat.

an distracting annoyance was the person who walked around constantly with a brightly lit tablet computer.  she must have passed by our table, and every other table in the room, at least 15 times per hour.   tttt"
2014-05-17,AnnF,4.0,"although we had to wait for a table (and had a reservation), management was responsive and thoughtful. waitress was excellent. food was delicious."
2014-05-17,pjmartinrn,5.0,"we showed up on time, but we waited 20 minutes for our reserved and confirmed table. the manager came by to apologize with a free appetizer of calamari. definitely made us feel appreciated."
2014-05-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent service! 
the hostess changed the time of the reservations with ease and accommodated us!!she also turned up lights in room for grandmother to see menu better.

the waiter was patient and kind. 

the servers were very prompt and listened to our requests. lemons napkins
it was an awesome afternoon !!"
2014-05-17,PamelaA,5.0,dinner was excellent. the spicy calamari in particular was so light it practically melted in our mouths.
2014-05-16,BarbaraW,4.0,"we eat here frequently and are never disappointed with our food.  however, i was surprised at how high the prices were this visit.  i think we last ate at legal's about 3 months earlier.  i ordered the schrod, which i love, but 21.95 seemed rather steep for this dish.  i'll still keep coming back because the food never disappoints."
2014-05-16,VisitingfromBoston,5.0,"had a wonderful dinner with friends.  i had the wood grilled assortment, one friend had the crabcake combo and the other had the trout.  all of our meals were great.  the service was great.  nice to know you can always count on legal."
2014-05-16,KevG,4.0,"legal isn't always the sexy pick, but it's consistently good fresh food.  what's not to like with that? always good for a night out with the in-laws or just a date night with or without our son."
2014-05-16,Margie,5.0,"i wanted you to know that we thought the service was outstanding.  sonja was extremely attentive and added to our dining experience.  we shall return and will definitely request her.  she is a great legal seafood representative. thank you, marge"
2014-05-13,size4,2.0,"the food and service was disappointing to say the least.  the food took a long time to be served and once the food came, i wished that i just ordered the salad and dessert.  i ordered the combo plate and the crab cake was cold and not visually appealing.  although the meal was quite pricey, i wouldn't have been happy with this food at any price.  my friend had to send her meal back twice as the muscles were just shells and she ended up ordering a shrimp cocktail which was very good. the bon bons for dessert are always a great little treat to end the meal.  the restaurant was very loud and the whole experience was disappointing."
2014-05-12,Seafood4u,5.0,"legal seafoods is a classic new england-based seafood restaurant with classic dishes like fish-and-chips and newer items like the wood grilled fish and shrimp! kid friendly and casual to dressy, it is simply a consistent favorite."
2014-05-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"delicious and good service. we had a bit of a delay in getting our meal out after the appetizer, but our server was very gracious and went the extra step to make it up to us."
2014-05-11,algonquian,5.0,didn't have to wait to long.  food was excellent.  very noisy.
2014-05-11,AuntieM,5.0,"my family and i dined at legal seafood, framingham, on mother's day and had a wonderful experince.  we were a party of 11, seated in a smaller intimate room at a large table; perfect spot for a large party.  the food was fresh, well presented, and delicious!  our server was attentive (without being overbearing), professional and very pleasant.  we were not rushed, able to relax and enjoy our meal.  i would  highly recommend leagl seafood!"
2014-05-11,Girl,5.0,"the food was fantastic! the service was wonderful!  we were seated at a booth in the lounge, but it was still really comfortable and fun.  i would recommend this legal sea foods location to anyone looking for a great date night location or for any special occasion.  we went for morher's day and it was very enjoyable."
2014-05-11,NotUpToPar,2.0,"we take my mom here every year, for at least the last 10 years, probably longer, in the last 5 years, my son joined the four of us, and now his wife. in addition, we visit often, we celebrate our wedding anniversary there, etc,  in the past it's been great, we've felt well taken care of. this year they put us in a 6 person booth, knowing we wanted lobsters, with very litte room, so only two of us got lobsters, the others opted for food that takes up less space. . our waitress was ok, but unlike the past, when they clear the table after eating and lay down smaller placemats and offer desert menus, those of us at the back of the booth had to sit with our dirty, fishy-smelling placemats, it ruined the ice cream and i only ate half of it.  sad."
2014-05-11,Ladiesniteout,5.0,excellent meals. all very fresh fish cooked to perfection. large portions. great sides. delicious desserts. wonderful service! very patient and kind. it was the dining experience you hope for.
2014-05-10,Disappointed,3.0,"delicious grilled salmon, along with a yummy caesar salad and garlic green beans.  our major complaint for legals is the noise level.  no matter when we go to legals, it is always noisy and hard to have a conversation.
we were very disappointed to see that some very healthy and interesting side dishes would cost us $1.50 extra.  legal's has had the same side dish offers for years.  if they want to add new ones, why charge more money?"
2014-05-10,Eattoomuch,3.0,"we seated quickly, but the service was under par. the meal came out incomplete and wood grilled lobster was not very good."
2014-05-10,SeaFoodGal,5.0,"the food is delicious and the service was awesome. the scene is romantic and calming.
the manager was constantly checking up on us and on how we were doing. a steak was over done and they took care of it right away. i would definitely recommend this place for special occasions."
2014-05-09,Kenn,4.0,"my favorite legals. the service in particular is wonderful, especially at the bar area, where the same service people have happily helped you for years."
2014-05-09,ICeman,3.0,"""no trip to boston is complete without visiting legal seafoods,"" so says my friend so we gave it a try.  kind of remindeds of mccormick and schmicks out on the west coast but with better food.  service was excellent and the food while not exceptional was interesting."
2014-05-03,buckeye50,3.0,"i've been to legal seafoods many times and in many places, and it is usually consistently good. this busy sat night in framingham was not one of its best. the room we were seated in was quite hot, and noisy (not unexpected on a sat night) the r.i. calamari was fine. a $30 piece of tuna was, in my opinion, not particularly fresh and was overcooked. the tuna sashimi did not seem that fresh, either. i also find the wine list to be a bit long in the tooth. service was o.k. although my guest was given the wrong desert."
2014-05-03,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"as always, we had a great experience.  my 6 year old was tired and cranky, and the wait staff took the extra time to make him laugh and even brought some extra oyster crackers to keep him occupied."
2014-05-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"this was our first time to legal seafood. i didn't like all the food i ordered, but it wasn't a matter of preparation, i was trying new things, it was all prepare well. the lobster was great. clam chowder was pretty good too. service excellent, and they decided not to charge me for the things i ordered and didn't like. our server and the manager tried to offer a substitute for the food i didn't like, but i was already full. i left happy either way. i would recommend this place for a nice dinner out. price wasn't too bad considering we had lobster. if i am in the area again, i will definitely go back."
2014-04-27,picky,4.0,"we go there often. a request to limit the cheese was not done. a mention to our waiter was answered with an apology ( good) & that he told the kitchen and that he was not the one who put it on(!!)
on the good side he reported it & the maître dee came over & also apologized sincerely & offered a return of the meal & free dessert. 
special of the day crab & avacado quesadea was terrific"
2014-04-27,FoodieFLMom,3.0,"ordered a dozen assorted oysters to share with my son.  very good and very fresh.  they only brought one fork and no spoons for the sauces.  by the time we got the spoons and second fork, we were done!  server took bread and butter away as soon as entrees were on the way - and we were still eating.  clam chowder was bland - needed some sherry or brandy.
steamed lobsters were ok - not great.  i prefer grilled lobsters. sides of onion sticks and brocoli were again just so-so.   lobster bake was huge portion of lobster, mussels and clams with corn.  son could not finish.
server was not that attentive after we got out entree.  had to flag him down for water."
2014-04-25,LindaC,4.0,my husband's halibut was slightly over done so he asked to have it recooked. they were very nice and took his food back and quickly replaced it with a perfectly cooked piece. they were more than happy to accomodate our friend's food allergies also. we have eaten at legal for years because they always take care of their customers.
2014-04-25,NBNative1962,3.0,"it took us 25 minutes to get our drinks, since they had run out of martini glasses.  it took us 1 hour to get our appetizers or even any bread.  so, all together, it took 2.5 hours to have dinner.  our server rarely checked in on us.  but of course, the food was terrific and so was our conversation, so we had a nice evening."
2014-04-21,JeanB,5.0,"from the moment we walked in, the service was top shelf.  our waitress made some excellent recommendations, and was very quick with out drinks and refills on water, which after the marathon is key :)  i was even escorted to the ladies room by the host.  first class all the way.  the food was amazing and cooked to perfection!  i only wish we had room for dessert!"
2014-04-20,jewelmom,4.0,"the food was as wonderful as usual. service was good. it was easter sunday and very busy, and a bit noisy. but we didn't feel rushed. we'll go back, but maybe not for easter dinner."
2014-04-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we ordered the oysters legal & mussels for appetizers then artic char and nutty salmon for main course. i ordered jasmine rice as a side  and  got white rice which was not very good, and they serve about a 1/2 lb of rock salt as a decoration for the oysters legal which i had to brush off the oysters but everything else was excellent. the waitress was perfect, always there when we wanted something but never bothersome.
i would recommend going if you like fish done right."
2014-04-20,Bernie,3.0,"a great way to celebrate with family and not have me doing all the cooking.  

only glitch was a computer went down and delayed paying for the meals with credit card."
2014-04-20,L1234,4.0,on holidays we take my father who enjoys seafood very much and as usual legal did not let us down it was excellent as always we will be back again in the future.
2014-04-19,Byoblover,2.0,"i have been to this location multiple times, and this is my first ,but also a substantial ,disappointment. we made a reservation and waited 15 minutes.  her patrons were agitated and didnt mind expressing their annoyance at the wait.  then once at the table, we waited for service.  the place was packed and the noise level was way too high. it's been a year but i saw changes in the menu which did not please me.  the portions were too large and it felt wasteful to leave so much on the table(we were staying in a hotel..so no take home leftovers.  so i doubt that we will return"
2014-04-18,LadiesNite,5.0,great place for a girls night with wine and apps. calamari was amazing and the cakebread wine was awesome as always!
2014-04-14,ZWag,5.0,"took a group of colleagues to legal and many of them had never been. outstanding food, great service, and a fun yet refined atmosphere. we all had a great time and nobody was disappointed with what they ordered."
2014-04-13,Jean,5.0,"every time we visit legal seafoods, we are
never disappointed! food and service is
always excellent. the food always taste fresh.
we always make reservations through opentable

will definitely go back!"
2014-04-12,Dave,4.0,"since we live near burlington, we used to go to the legal seafoods in the burlington mall. however, over the last couple of years the service declined and in several instances the food quality declined. this legal seafoods (in framingham) still retains the higher level of quality and service that we've been used to from the chain over the last 3+ decades..."
2014-04-12,Cricket,5.0,"every time i visit legal seafood i am always happy. i had requested a quiet area because i had an elderly person in the group that is hard of hearing. this request, on a busy saturday night, was accommodated. this means a lot to me. the fish was fresh, abundant and flavorful. we live locally, so this is a place we frequent."
2014-04-11,Bert,4.0,"legal seafoods is always top notch. service is professional and wonderful. food is outstanding. by far the freshest, most consistent seafood & fish on the market. menus selection is fantastic with a wide variety to satisfy everyone at your table. save room for dessert!! their bananas foster is to die for, it is a must have!!"
2014-04-08,Bobzilla,3.0,"the food tasted good but it was looked barren on the plate. was in a group of 5 and not one of the plates looked that appealing. the waitress did her job but with no fealing. the restaurant was not crowded so i don't know what the issues were that prevented her from being a little more upbeat.

i will come back because i know they usually do better just not this night."
2014-04-08,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"what is there to say about legal? always reliably excellent menu, food, service. this is my go to for a proper setting for a business lunch in metrowest...."
2014-04-07,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we were seated rigth away becasue we did have a reservation. the food was great as we expected. we were surprised whent he server brought bon-bons to help us celebrate my wife's birthday. however, our request to accomadate my father-in-law's special needs were ignored, as well as making him even more unsure on his feet even with his walker to assist his mobility. i wonder if special notes within a reservation request are read by those planning the seating. happy to say we did make it home ok. but this incident will make us have a second thought when we next plan dinner with him, and wondering if we will have the same issues"
2014-04-06,ClaudiaWey,3.0,used to be our number one choice when going out for dinner. we discovered the place with moving from california 10 years ago. few years ago something changed. the service was scaled down and the menu since then hasn't changed since. it is very unexciting to order out of the same menu for years. it has become now our last resource for dining. this is pretty sad; it was one of our first choice.
2014-04-04,Carol,5.0,"on this occasion, the dish i ordered is a long time favorite of mine. this time it was beyond expectations: more than marvelous!"
2014-04-04,KerriG,5.0,great fresh food in an energetic and friendly environment. i love legal because it's easy to pick something healthy and still feel like i am treating myself to a nice dinner out.
2014-04-04,Update,4.0,per usual food was excellent. and so wa service. even though our waitress was a little over the top with pushing extras .
2014-04-02,Cdahl207,5.0,"i love the seafood here! i love the atmosphere. it's food quality is what makes this place awesome! free seafood, meats and ingredients. i recommend making reservations ahead of time. it's a busy place and might end up waiting 30-45mins but still worth the wait!"
2014-04-02,MJ88,4.0,"dinner here last night on business with a friend. both meals were quite good, not extraordinary, but definitely ok. fish (swordfish and striped bass) was definitely fresh. service was prompt, professional, and helpful. noise level a bit high. good (and fairly priced) wine list."
2014-03-29,Gina,2.0,fish was over cooked and had too much butter. i left with stomach pains.
2014-03-29,Runner,2.0,"this is our usual place and love it when we are in boston but this last time we were put in a small room with a big party and i could not even hear my family, could not talk with out yelling, very disappointing. also the ac came on and we all sat their with coats on and they could not do anything about it."
2014-03-29,Welovetoeat,4.0,legal seafood never disappoints! we were attended to fairly quickly. the food came out without much waiting and it was superb as always. loved the visit!!

absolutely awful sweet potato fries....whoever cuts them into shoestrings and covers them with flour yuk!!

2014-03-20,clang25,3.0,"took almost an hour for food to arrive, but it was very good when it did"
2014-03-19,Hummer9,3.0,"i had the lobster bisque followed by grilled haddock and scallops. the lobster bisque was very average. probably wouldn't order it again. the haddock was rather tasteless while the scallops were very good. i have eaten at legal sea foods many times and this was a bit unusual with regard to the quality of the meal. perhaps it was just my selection of fish. the berry tart for dessert was outstanding, but the dessert shouldn't completely overshadow the entrée. i'll probably go back but would order something else."
2014-03-15,MegA,2.0,"we often go to legal for a date night out, as it is close to home and typically enjoyable. however, the food quality was less than average on this particular visit. i often order the wood plank salmon with lemon chive butter, as i again ordered at this visit. we think they forgot our order because they cleared our appetizer plates and brought us another tables food. after the mixup, our food came about 25 minutes later. i say this because my salmon was extremely undercooked and there was no lemon chive butter, which is one of my favorite parts of this particular meal. overall, a disappointing visit. usually a go-to spot for us but that may be changing. we rarely get a night away from the kids and we want it to be reliable."
2014-03-15,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my wife and i were headed to see a play at a local theater and wanted a nice dinnr before the show. using opentable, as we do whenever we can, we reserved a table at legal sea foods in framingham, ma. although there was others waiting for their tables, we were seated right away and received the great food and servce we have come to expect at legals. we both had fish (big surprise!), i had the chowder and she a house salad before the main course. we finished our dinner, without rushing, and drove to the volkes theater for a great show. the prompt seating, becase of our reseved table, allowed freedom from the stress which sometimes can come from having to wait for an open table. thanks opentable!"
2014-03-14,Mitch,2.0,came in on a friday around 7 with a reservation for 7:30. seated promptly in a nice corner table in the lounge area. service was very inconsistent. we wanted to get food from the raw bar & saw a treasures of the sea thing and the server upsold us to the large one. he said it is usually for 6-8 people and its huge and we will love it. it came out and we were very disappointed. the bottom tier looked only half full with 6 oysters & 6 clams. the top tier was filled with lobster which was great (but we couldn't eat it because the waiter never brought claw crackers until we had to ask him when he came over 15 minutes later) and some of the tiniest mussels i have ever seen. the smoked salmon was delicious though! i would hesitate to come back.

2014-03-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the fish was as fresh as i would have expected from legals and perfectly cooked. the wait staff was friendly and available without hovering. we made reservations ahead of time and were immediately taken to a table that was in the quieter part of the restaurant, which was perfect, since we wanted to catch up with one another. no one hurried us. it was a lovely evening."
2014-03-02,AndyD,4.0,"as always the food was good and consistent. service was always very good. but it's vastly overpriced. this was for a special occasion so we took the family but unless you're having corporate pay for it then for that price you can go to a non-chain restaurant. legal is good, but not that good."
2014-03-01,dinnerwithdad,4.0,"as always, the food was reliably good and the service excellent. my complaint is that even with a reservation we waited half and hour."
2014-03-01,Occasionaldiner4,3.0,good caesar salads. scallops were fabulous. very disappointing swordfish. who wants to pay $30 for a small piece of frozen swordfish? shame on legals for that. your restaurant is expensive and a certain food quality is expected across the board.
2014-03-01,FredB,4.0,legal seafood always delivers outstanding seafood. never misses.
2014-02-28,sagvig,3.0,"i've been going to legal restaurants for 30 years. legal has long been reliable for most seafood dishes, but we consistently find that the cocktails are a ripoff. straight-up drinks in martini glasses are skimpy and very watery. likewise, cocktails on ice like mojitos are just that - all ice. stick with wine and beer - they have a good, reasonably priced selection. avoid ""ethnic"" specials which may tempt an adventurous diner, but we've found legal's chefs just can't pull it off properly. stick with the tried and true - raw bar, steamed lobster, wood grilled fish, lobster roll, fried clams, chowder, steamed clams, crab cakes, fried calamari. one exception there - i've found the fish and chips to be disappointing - greasy, thick batter."
2014-02-28,DoolinDalton,4.0,"legal is reliably great. i cannot recall a visit that has disappointed. this time was no exception. food was great. the seafood is always very fresh and well prepared. service was a bit slow because our server was also covering two large tables, but the food came out quickly enough. i will always come back to legal."
2014-02-26,Swiszo,4.0,whenever i'm in framingham i make it a point to visit
2014-02-25,John,3.0,as always their food is dependable and a reasonable selection. the sushi was over spiced but all was fresh and well presented. there could be a wider variety of more unusual offerings but what they had was good.
2014-02-24,Marsha,5.0,"wonderful fish, great restaurant overall."
2014-02-23,Northendfan,3.0,legals always offer high quality at affordable prices. my husband and i had a great meal there and sat at the bar. while we were not in a rush the service was a bit slow. this is not typical for them.... we would definitely go back again.
2014-02-23,Chuck,3.0,"legal seafood has been my favorite restaurant for many years. the food is always good, and while a bit pricey, the freshness of the food makes it worthwhile. unfortunately, the food quality seems to have deteriorated. on a visit saturday with friends, all of us commented that the food, while ok, was just not great. i hope it was just an off night, as i just don't know where i could start to go for great fish!"
2014-02-23,Tommyzaz,5.0,"legal sea foods continues to keep up it's high quality sea food.
recommend starting with new england clam chowder.
nice selection of wines."
2014-02-22,ellenb,4.0,"very, very busy earl saturday evening. service was very good. and the seafood was very good as well. only wish their choices for sides had more green veggies versus carbs."
2014-02-22,Jboysmom,5.0,"as usual, another terrific meal at legal sea foods. went early on saturday for a dual birthday celebration. service and food were terrific. we were not rushed and all five of us enjoyed our food. highly recommend."
2014-02-22,August,4.0,always good service at legals framingham. you can expect a very good meal time and time again.
2014-02-19,SergioM,4.0,good atmosphere but a bit noisy. service was excellent and very reasonable prices for good wine choices to complement a very good dinner
2014-02-16,MrsC,4.0,"part of one of our orders was a tad late, and legal seafood took 100% of the item off our bill.

this was a great place to take our college kid out for a special meal he won't get in the dining hall.

i will definitely eat here again next time i'm in town."
2014-02-16,may14,5.0,"the food was excellent and was only outdone by the outstanding service. our waitress was delightful. the hostess and the other wait staff were also very nice. there seemed to be camaraderie amongst the staff. another nice bonus here is that if you want a small glass of wine, they have small pours as opposed to full glasses of wine. this was perfect for me at lunchtime."
2014-02-16,James,5.0,"once again my fiance and i enjoyed a wonderful meal. chris was there and was kind of enough to stop by our table to say hello. chris was the waiter that took care of us dec 7th when i proposed to my now fiance. it was awesome that he remembered and took the time to chat. legal seafood will always hold a special place in our hearts, stomachs too!!!!!"
2014-02-15,Diningout14,4.0,the food is always good at legal seafood - no matter what you order. we always have a consistently good experience here. the food was once again excellent. you must try the chowder which is served at the presidential inauguration. the prices are a little high but you get what you pay for. during our last visit the service was a little bit slow because it was a friday night which was also valentine's day but we didn't have to wait too long for our reserved table and while the food came a little slower than usual valentine's day was a nice day to spend a little longer at dinner.
2014-02-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"had a reservation for 7pm on valentines day. we got there at 7, and the place was packed. we were seated at 7:02. first time ever i made a reservation on a very busy night, and was actually seated without having to wait a half hour. friendly staff. food is pricey, but then again, it's legal's. you have to expect that. food was very good as usual. great staff."
2014-02-07,Peter,4.0,"no matter what we order, it seems any appetizer, entree or desert are alway good. service is alway exceptional. legal hires quality people, regardless of location."
2014-02-01,Rich,4.0,"one in our party ordered a special, but with changed sides, another asked for fried oysters to be made a dinner entree, and one ordered directly off the menu. our waiter, sergi was extremely accommodating and even asked about holding our entrees since we were lingering over first courses. the staff was very friendly and the attention paid to us was just right and not obtrusive. all of our food was of excellent quality and expertly prepared."
2014-02-01,Dick,4.0,this legal is the best managed in the boston area.
2014-01-29,Laura,3.0,"scallops were not good as expected, very pricey. i was seated with the view of the waitress service area. it was very noisy."
2014-01-26,Disappointed,5.0,grilled salmon at legals is fantastic
2014-01-25,Mimi,3.0,"the fish is fresh and delicious. it is extremely busy on weekends, making service slow and noise level too loud!"
2014-01-25,drhc,5.0,"as always, the food and service are fantastic. always prepared perfectly and served graciously with very personable waitstaff."
2014-01-25,diner,5.0,great dinner and the service was excellent
2014-01-25,out2dine,4.0,"we were a little disappointed that our reservation did not quickly get us a table, we waited about 20 min. but the service and food made up for the wait. our waiter was very helpful, made us feel welcome and made sure we were taken care of. he suggested a menu special that we had not noticed, grilled lobster with cauliflower, saffron, raisins, pine nuts and pasta. the dish was delicious and light. once a week they offer special dishes if you like to try something different. the legal clam chowder is always a must have appetizer for us! we haven't been to legals for a while and really enjoyed this visit, so we will return again soon."
2014-01-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"el ambiente es muy bueno, tranquilo, el servicio fue excelente y la comida riquisima.
un elegante lugar donde ir a festejar cumpleaños, aniversarios o cualquier ocasion especial.
felicitaciones!!!!!"
2014-01-23,Pesky67sal,2.0,"disappointing for sure, fish was okay but bland, the plate was very unappealing, looked like diner or cafeteria plate, with vegetables looking like they were ""plopped"" onto the plate with very little care and very bland tasting. not worth the price. service was great, waiter very attentive and management and staff very professional."
2014-01-21,Jimm,5.0,"lunch was great, service was wonderful, and enjoyed it very much."
2014-01-21,Mebucko,5.0,the service was outstanding along with the food.
2014-01-18,Janet9477,5.0,service and food couldn't be better!
2014-01-17,Eater,3.0,this used to be a reliable meal. last few trips have been well below expectations at higher prices. will think hard before returning.
2014-01-10,patrish95,3.0,this legal's location always seems to be hopping whenever we visit. consistently good food. something for everyone on the menu. haven't been disappointed yet.
2014-01-08,AlysonK,3.0,"food was okay, but side dish selection was not very good.
prices for what you get are very high."
2014-01-06,LeftyjJ,5.0,snow storm so few people but as usual the service was great and the food too!
2014-01-04,Lovesfish,5.0,wonderful consistent food and service for over 25 years - we keep going back!
2014-01-01,birthday,4.0,3 out of 4 meals were wonderful.
2014-01-01,BarbaraW,3.0,food is good but no special entrees/recipes...all pretty basic but fresh and consistent yet overpriced.
2014-01-01,JimR,5.0,"from the greeting at the door of happy new year by maitre d'....to the fast and efficient and cheerful service at the table (sean) ...to the hot food being served, the total evening was a great way to start the new year.
considering that this was new year's eve, everything was like clock work."
2014-01-01,Mkway,4.0,"we eat there about once, sometimes twice a month and the great food is always consistently good! we eat in the bar area mostly and the bar staff is always attentive."
2014-01-01,Denbrook,5.0,celebrated our 51st wedding anniversary with a new year's eve dinner and we had a wonderful time. asked for a booth in the reservation and they had it ready for us. we were immediately seated at about 7:00 pm and the server knew about our anniversary and was really excellent. we were not rushed and our two hour meal was leisurely and pleasant.
2013-12-31,Chas,4.0,we had a great dinner to celebrate new year's. this location is close to home so didn't have to worry about a long drive.
2013-12-30,shawnlaugh,2.0,"two couples out for business, well dressed and well behaved. our guests arrived 15 minutes late. i ordered a glass of wine while we sat and waited. when they arrived, all ordered cocktails and i ordered another glass of wine.ordered dinner 25 minutes later. with entree i ordered another glass of wine- everyone else had another cocktail. halfway through entrees,i ordered another glass of wine. manager arrived waving our ordering history and informed me that i had to wait ""about 13 minutes"" to have another glass. needless to say, i was embarrassed, and it put a quick end to the ordering of anything at the table. we finished up, paid the check- still shaking our heads about it several months later-would never dream of going back."
2013-12-30,CupcakeWonk,3.0,"fantastic waitress (nicole). menu does not list all available, inclusive sides (such as spinach and butternut squash)."
2013-12-28,DocMom2nana,5.0,"grat place for all of us. they seated us with some bench seating that made things perfect for our new little grandchild in her infant car seat. great atmosphere for all of us...family included late teens too. food was wonderful, including rolls, chowder, and main courses. waiter was very attentive and all was really wonderful for a great family dinner."
2013-12-28,GwennO,5.0,excellent meal and fantastic gluten free menu. legals is one of our favorite restaurants for family meals and special events. one member of our family is gluten free and legals has one of the best gluten free menus in the area. it's great to be able to go out to eat and know that everyone in the family can order amazing food.
2013-12-27,Charlie,4.0,"excellent seafood, broad variety."
2013-12-27,Cat511,5.0,"we eat here at least once a month and the food is always amazing. our server was the only thing lacking about this particular dinner. we had to keep asking her to repeat herself as she spoke so quietly, the restaurant wasn't loud either. she was very attentive until we received our salads then she was just gone. when we were done eating we finally flashed her down to get the check and she disappeared again which was a problem as it was not our check. one off the hosts or managers finally took pity on us and was able to finish our check out process. we will of course come back, the food is phenomenal we will just hope to get a different server."
2013-12-26,dinerdiva,5.0,i usually have the swordfish and it never disappoints - outstanding
2013-12-25,Skip,3.0,"we had a large party for a special occasion we were celebrating. at first when we gave them our name and offered to give them our confirmation number from open table, they told us the reservation was for four not seven. i had forwarded the reservation to my adult daughter and also had the confirmation that had been emailed that day with it saying seven not four. we had to wait about 20 minutes for them make arrangements for us. we did have small children with us so the energy level was high in having to wait.

the waiter had several tables, some with large parties like ours so out order was delayed after taking ours so he could also wait on other table of six. he did really try hard to accommodate us though. the food-delicious."
2013-12-25,Lillismum,2.0,"four of us went for dinner, and four of us we're disappointed . we had fresh oysters to start , and loved them . had we just had the oysters , we would have been happy !!! i had the mahi special, came with brussel sprouts and sweet potato . my fish was lackluster with dry bread crumbs on top , veggies were good. all dinners were not so pretty to look at . husband had tuna, med rare, that's what he got. kale came in a separate dish .. a little to salty but okay. the tuna lacked a swirl of a dipping sauce, or any other edible garnish... slightly browned chunk of fish on plate period. the fish was fresh , no question , but it doesn't matter if they are blah ! so sad to all be let down at $300 plus ( including tip) two words summer shack !!!!"
2013-12-25,Christie,5.0,i love the special attention the staff gives their guests. our visit was a special occasion (christmas dinner). the food was excellent everyone left feeling full and satisfied. service was paced well we never felt rushed. the food was cooked to perfection!
2013-12-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we have been already several times at lf, this time we did it on the 24th, we like the ambience, the food and the attention.
we'll be back soon for another great meal."
2013-12-25,Chrisfromthecape,4.0,baked stuffed lobster for christmas dinner was yummy. skip the calamari it was bland. crab cake delicious. one of had the steak which was over cooked returned and just ok. stick to seafood which they do well.
2013-12-25,Angela,4.0,minor complaint. we had reservations for christmas eve but still had to wait 10-15 minutes when we arrived. food was outstanding!
2013-12-24,Millie,5.0,the staff was very attentive on this busy christmas eve...the bar was festive and the dining room was comfortable. food was excellent and came out in a timely fashion. our waitress was well versed on the menu and wine....over all a wonderful experience.
2013-12-24,peachy,5.0,a wonderful place for a festive dinner with family. fantastic food and a very special evening. thank you!
2013-12-23,mikec127,3.0,over priced for dinner...better for lunch.

2013-12-21,oystercracker,5.0,"our local favorite, $1 oyster special weekend afternoons after lunch rush and a knowledgeable waiter who caters to our needs."
2013-12-20,Charlotte7753,5.0,excellent spot for lunch offering reliably good seafood dishes.
2013-12-20,IloveRita,5.0,really impressed with the training level of the staff. everyone is very friendly and professional. and the food is outstanding!!
2013-12-19,Varitek33,3.0,"last week, i went for a late afternoon holiday lunch with some work friends.one of the very few times that i've been disappointed with legals. the chowder was good, but not as great as usual. i had the seafood trio - fried clams, shrimp and scallops. overcooked and not very tasty. unfortunately, this was a very disappointing visit."
2013-12-18,BzLady,4.0,"good food. the chef's are pretty accomodating when it comes to ""cooked-to-order"" requests.

if you love ""rainbow trout"" (like me), i have to say, legal's is the best!"
2013-12-13,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"i have celiac disease and feel incredibly comfortable eating at legals, which i cannot say for other restaurants, they are extremely attentive to my needs and the food is hot and delicious.

the server was very professional and made sure that our experience was excellent.

a great night out."
2013-12-11,Meeg,5.0,great food & drinks. recommend reservation as this place was pretty busy.
2013-12-09,Derecp,4.0,"a sunday evening meal for a change. quiet, but pleasant atmosphere. the standard of the food is refreshingly consistent. slightly disappointed in the malbec ($10.50 per glass), but the service, was pleasant and efficient."
2013-12-08,George,5.0,"in town just for a few days for business and had late night dinner. restaruant was easy to find, clean and food was great! will return again."
2013-12-08,Roxy,5.0,you know you will get a well prepared meal.
2013-12-01,Family,4.0,this is a great restaurant! my one issue is if i go to the trouble of making a reservation i don't understand why i was given such a bad table! i was put in the first table as you walk in and every time the door was open on this cold evening we felt the cold draft!
2013-11-29,MSPFoodie,5.0,was back in boston and met my best college friends at legals for some fun drinks and always excellent seafood. had to have the new england clam chowder and all of our entrées were delightful.
2013-11-28,Laurie,3.0,the food was not as good as usual but i'm sure this had to do with the fact that it was thanksgiving. my mother did order the turkey dinner and unfortunately they had run out of butternut squash :( the fish and chips were sub-par. i was disappointed as we usually have a very good meal there. the service was excellent and overall it was a great time.
2013-11-28,Pammy,4.0,great food! ~the nutty almond crusted salmon was superb!.....and the dessert to get is the boston creme pie! omg! to die for....good service. our party loved the crab cakes....fresh tuna ......can't wait to go back...
2013-11-28,Roxianna,3.0,pedestrian. i was expecting a special fall holiday pre fix menu. instead we got a blue plate special.
2013-11-28,Saltolove,5.0,"we've been going to lsf for many years, at several locations. natick is our local spot. part of the menu is always changing, and it seems every time we go they give us a new ""wow""."
2013-11-28,Partyof5,4.0,"this was our first thanksgiving out and we decided on legals because the food is good, they offered a traditional meal and also had seafood for those who did not want turkey. our original reservation was for 4 but at the last minute we added a one more. the staff was very accommodating in the change. when we arrived i was a little dismayed because we were seated in the bar facing the waiters station, so lots of fast traffic, crashing ice and things being rung up. i wish that they had put us somewhere nicer. one of our party was handicapped so once we were seated we did not feel up to a move and thus did not ask for another table.

our waitress was terrific and the food was very good as one expects from legals."
2013-11-26,marjo,4.0,can't beat the fresh raw bar and seafood. not elegant but always good and plenty of wine by the glass.
2013-11-23,DannyTeebone,5.0,"can't go wrong here, even for non sea food lovers like myself."
2013-11-21,may14,5.0,"excellent service and a very friendly atmosphere. the staff there seemed very happy and spirited.
the salad was very good with plenty of blue cheese and finely chopped tomatoes. the fish was cooked perfectly. the ice cream bon bons were a perfect ending to the meal. the wine the our waitress recommended was perfect for our meals. we weren't quite sure which wine to order so we were very impressed by the questions our waitress asked us in order to help us choose the right wine."
2013-11-21,MermaidSoul,3.0,"while the seafood was pretty good, it took a long time for it to arrive, and it seemed the server would disappear for long periods of time. all of the seafood was prepared as ordered and indicated on the menu. some of the sides were disappointing - root vegetables (undercooked and extra cost), roasted mushrooms (soaking in oil and extra cost), and the jalapeno cheddar polenta was liked dry cornbread - not what expected. the servers were very accommodating to our large group, however - it just took them a long time to get it done. for example, a glass of water took 10 minutes to arrive. this restaurant location could also use a makeover. it looked tired to me."
2013-11-17,beckys,4.0,the food was delicious and the service was great. the prices were higher that i remember.
2013-11-11,Bruce,4.0,"we arrived at 8:30 pm and or group was there to catch-up. it was very nice to not be rushed even though we hadn't realized that we had reached closing time. our waiter remained attentive and helpful, even when we were the only remaining customers.
it was a pleasure enjoying the very good cuisine and never feeling hurried,"
2013-11-10,pattyp,3.0,"i took a friend here to celebrate her birthday. i thought legals was special. i made my reservation at open table. i mentioned it was my friends birthday, and a certain area we like to be seated in-neither of which were granted.
the side choices i thought were very slim. not a lot of choices for what they offered on the menu. i opted for spinach as did my girlfriend. she typically love spinach, and couldn't eat it. i left mine as well.
i always thought this was a special occasion place. in the past i've always sat at the bar for appetizers. in the future, that is all i will do. for dinner i was very disappointed."
2013-11-10,drhc,4.0,had a great dinner and wait staff very attentive and very personable.
2013-11-05,Diner,3.0,"note this occasion was for lunch at the framingham location. the restaurant does not have a lot of character. in order to dine with daylight during the day, the only seating is in the bar. food is fine and service is good."
2013-11-03,PatrickM,2.0,"for the price we paid...scallops we got were small and very few- 5 to be exact, haddock was over cooked, very dry .
not worth the money"
2013-11-01,JamesP,5.0,excellent meal made even better by terrific wait staff.
2013-10-29,FoodLover,4.0,"we were a group of 5 that shared the app of seared tuna/shrimp cocktail, crab cakes and shrimp wonton. it was excellent. also had a cup of clam chowder and entree of wood grilled scallops. outstanding dinner and service. as usual."
2013-10-26,Lillian,3.0,"waitress was very nice and knowledgeable enough to recommend items for gluten-free diner in our party. crab cakes were very good. fish stew was good. not sure why lobster is still highly priced since it's abundant in new england right now. spinach side was disappointing as it just tasted like boiled large leaves without being trimmed. drinks and wine were good. kids liked (a lot) chicken fingers and pizza! overall, the staff is great, food very good for a suburban restaurant."
2013-10-25,bararn,5.0,"the framingham restaurant is the best of all the local competitors and even better than the chestnut hill operation. the food, the service, and location are all excellent. the waitstaff is outstanding and the chef is marvelous. a slight negative is the noise level, but most great restaurants of similar size suffer the same issue."
2013-10-23,teachermass,4.0,"good food, but really loud and hard to have a conversation. there were several big groups, so that might have been why, but it was so loud that it took away from enjoying the experience."
2013-10-23,gigi,5.0,the gluten free accomodation is fabulous! the best! thanks so much!!!!
2013-10-20,Chuck,5.0,very nice restaurant to eat. we go for all bdays. and when we want a real nice place to have a good dinner.
2013-10-14,vagirl,2.0,"columbus day night-waited one hour for meal to arrive at table. kitchen was in complete disarray. server was fair, lacked interest in our wait time. manager was great. he was trying to help with the situation."
2013-10-12,itsalldownhill,4.0,"this is my wife's favorite restaurant. always have a good meal here. i was a little disappointed about where they sat us. it was a corner where two rows of booths came together with a tiny table. we were very close to other diners. when i say close i mean for someone to get up, another diner had to get up to let us out. not for the claustrophobic. service was outstanding."
2013-10-12,JustWantAGoodMeal,4.0,"you can count on consistently solid fish with innovative preparations and a good bar.

2013-10-12,Neillovesfish,5.0,"my favorite restaurant, never had a bad meal or service. 5 star"
2013-10-10,Dick,4.0,we go often because it is excellent but this time was really special because we had to evacuate due to a kitchen fire.
2013-10-05,SusieQ,5.0,"as always the food was fresh and delicious. what most impressed me most was that despite being packed with people waiting for tables, they honored our reservation and seated us immediately.
the service was attentive. the only downside was the noise, but it was saturday night at prime time."
2013-10-04,Dlivermore,3.0,"excellent fish, variety of seasonal specials, and consistently good service combine to deliver a reliably good dining experience. highly recommend you include lsf in your ""dinner out"" restaurant rotation. it doesn't rise to the level of ""special occasion"", but they deliver a solid meal any day of the week. reservations recommended for this popular spot."
2013-10-01,Carol,5.0,"had a super ladies night out last night....delicious ciappinno, warm rolls, yum!"
2013-09-28,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food was great, restaurant is beautiful, server was very prompt and efficient but kind of rough around the edges."
2013-09-27,marktwain,5.0,"great food, great service, definitely will go again, a bit noisy."
2013-09-26,Dinger,4.0,nicole h. was our server which was the high spot of the evening. she was right on it with a smile no matter what we asked and always offered more rolls. food was good as it always is at ls. our first time to this one and it was great. i wish they had given us a bigger table though. they seated us at a tiny 1/2 table glued to the wall even though it wasn't that busy. over all it was fine and we will return.
2013-09-24,Teach8809,3.0,surprised that i booked this through open table and specially wrote it was my wife's birthday. not one person there acknowledged her birthday or said happy birthday. kinda defeats the purpose of leaving the additional information.
2013-09-24,drhc,5.0,continues to serve highest quality food by knowledgeable and friendly wait staff. hosts are always trying to accommodate special requests.
2013-09-21,Greg,2.0,the grilled tuna was cold and had a grey look to it. it was un appealing. the mashed potatoes were warm and hard. the baked potato looked like it had been sitting around for quite some time. all in all the meal was not enjoyable.
2013-09-21,ncampy,4.0,"i've recently changed eating habits for a challenge at my gym...i became one of those annoying diners who grill the waitstaff about preparation...our waitress was wonderful, and very patient. the service overall was very attentive, efficient and pleasant. would return!!"
2013-09-18,DRMoran,3.0,"raw oysters simply fab, sides like chard and mushrooms ditto, surprisingly. wines excellent and good value. lobster excellent but overpriced given how much they go for this year. fried clams outstanding, not overdone, better than from clamshacks including lobster pool in rockport. calamari awful, dry, small rings, boring, not too tasty. if they did calamari on the wood-fired list i would go every other night. onion strings also awful, an excuse for breading markup. boston cream pie dessert also spectacular."
2013-09-14,Chuck,5.0,the food was very good. i would take any one to try the seafood.
2013-09-14,Lely,4.0,the food was so good i will love to go back there.
2013-09-11,bostonmum,4.0,legals continues to be a nice place to meet with friends and family and enjoy great new england seafood. even on a very busy night (like ours!) the staff are attentive and food delicious.
2013-09-10,2loud,2.0,the title says it. our fish was dry and the restaurant was so noisy it was hard to hear our guest across the table.
2013-09-06,Notsittingintheback,3.0,"i confirmed a reservation for 6:15pm through open table. there were three of us in the party. the host walked us past many open tables and then sat us in the far back next to a noisy service walkway. they did move us easily upon our request. my point is, why use open table for a reservation when i would have done better walking in off the street?"
2013-09-02,Kenn,4.0,one of my favorite legals. a seat at the bar or those surrounding the bar are great. service at this legals bar seats is always astounding.
2013-09-01,Dale,4.0,"always great fresh fish and the best clam chowder around.
the framingham/natick location is always busy and can get very loud. it is not the place to go for quiet conversation or to linger over coffee. my favorite is to sit in the bar area at the high top tables. you can't get better fish anywhere. the fried fish is not greasy and the swordfish is always cooked perfectly."
2013-09-01,Yummy,4.0,the food and service was very good. however the dinning rooms are very noisey. hard to have conversations. everything else was excellent and would definitely go back there. fish tasted very fresh.
2013-08-31,Jonsax,4.0,one of the few restaurants in the area that one can count on for a good meal every time.
2013-08-28,OpenTable Diner,2.0,tables were cramped together . waitress service was slow. too dark/small print on menu.
2013-08-26,Frank,4.0,"it was a busy evening and the restaurant was at full or near full capacity. our waitress was helpful but got our drink orders wrong, never brought out our lobster bisque, until i mentioned i never received it when our dinner order arrived at the table. we would have ordered additional alcoholic drinks if our waitress had come back to our table. in her defense she was running between tables but we expected more. the food was great, we had a mix of dinner meals, steaks, fish, seafood and a casserole and everyone enjoyed their food. on the plus side, we were not charged for the lobster bisque that arrived late and with our dinner meals."
2013-08-26,Carol,5.0,"food sets the standard for excellence -- best quality; in a word, delicious always."
2013-08-25,DaveMabe,5.0,"seated within minutes of arrival, had a superior waitress (corey) for eight people, seafood arrived quickly beginning with oysters. it was simply spectacular. a little pricey when the check arrived, ~$70 per person-tip included."
2013-08-24,John,3.0,"overall good but the sides leave something to be desired. for the prices charged, there could be a better selection of vegetables and side orders. also, some of the dishes come with no starch and in those cases, the starches must be ordered separately.
again, for the prices charged, it would seem reasonable to include some potato or rice as part of the selection and not have to pay extra for them.
we do like it and will go back but some minor changes should like those above should be made."
2013-08-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the food and service is great but the noise level is akin to eating on a runway at logan. one had to lean in to hear someone on the other side of a rectangular table three feet away which became tiresome.
2013-08-15,Momsday,4.0,our waiter wa fantastic and the food was superb!
2013-08-15,Luvgoodeats,4.0,"good sea food, of course, but also a good gluten free menu and the best gluten free rolls around."
2013-08-12,Janel,3.0,waitress was extremely rude and obviously didn't enjoy her job but food was delicious
2013-08-09,LWagner,5.0,always dependable for an exceptional dining experience!
2013-08-09,Giwi,4.0,"food was great. once in a booth was better

noise level in back room at table was unbearable. we were given last table in back room clearly most undesirable table in the place. we had originally asked for a booth they said there was no booth. after realizing the noise was awful we asked for a quieter table and were given one. we noticed four empty booths. wonder why they didn't give us what we wanted in the first place. we had a reservation and are long time customers. very disappointing service."
2013-08-07,MNLovebirds,4.0,"upon request, the kitchen will prepare a lobster casserole (lobster meat, cracker crumbs, cheese, and a white sauce) that is excellent."
2013-08-02,DanielM,5.0,"i visit regularly when in the area, and have yet to be disappointed in any aspect. food is good, service excellent, and atmosphere always nice."
2013-07-29,Luv2doWIne,4.0,excellent dinner here with my dad and his wife. we love the fresh seafood and delicious rolls they serve hot from the oven. highly recommend if you are visiting boston. it's very expensive but well worth the trip. we will be returning:)
2013-07-25,picky,4.0,"waiter was very knowledgable about the raw oysters and helped me select a few new types. good suggestions.
he was not quite as good for the wines. said he know what he was talking about. maybe he mixed up the descriptions.
however overall was a great waiter.
salmon & lobster at our table were very good."
2013-07-18,HC70,5.0,there is no better seafood resturant west of boston!!!!
2013-07-13,fred,3.0,"we generally like this restaurant and the food.our service was great. the cioppino sauce was bland. the appetizer mussels were outstanding. my fish dish was wonderful and plentiful. we had reservations for 7:15. we were given a pager and were seated at 7:40. not so good for a restaurant of this quality and reputation, and that's our biggest complaint."
2013-07-11,murray300,4.0,"look, this is not a gourmet restaurant. what it is is the freshest, best quality fish served usually in a simple preparation. it's not cheap, but top quality seldom is."
2013-07-09,Donna,1.0,usually i love legals but i have been meaning to write them informing them of the most sub-par experience evet. it was a business lunch... the waitress was robotic and cold. the food was terrible... the ahi tuna had a terrible texture and no taste... just lots of peppercorns. a business associate had the shrimp ceasar salad... talk about boring!!!! the schrod looked ok and so did the lobster roll....and have they thought about updating their menu??? its been the same forever. bad time
2013-07-07,LarryO,4.0,"simply the best place to dine if you want quality seafood. i've never been disappointed with either the quality of the food or the service. they have a nice wine list and daily chef specials. i've had both their fried seafood and their wood grilled offerings and both are excellent.

for the non-seafood lover in the group, they also do a nice job on their filet."
2013-06-29,John,5.0,the staff made us feel welcome and comfortable for our anniversary dinner.
2013-06-23,SjCi,5.0,the best seafood and fish restaurant i have visited. the good food along with the great service keep me coming back
2013-06-22,JohnE,3.0,"food was awesome and serving size was generous. visited on a saturday night. we were asked if we wanted to take a seat in the lounge. the maître d' mentioned the higher chairs which were fine, but i wish we would have understood that this room was much noisier because of the tile floor and the bar keepers tossing empty bottles in a bin. i would definitely go back, but would insist on sitting in the main dining room."
2013-06-22,OpenStudio,4.0,"we've eaten here many times and it never gets old. when we reserve on opentable we are always seated immediately and we've always gotten a booth like we requested. we marvel at the crowds waiting for a table at the front and we wonder why they don't reserve on opentable. it's kind of like the long lines waiting at the toll booths who don't use easypass. anyway, the food is always delicious and tonight the waitress was at the peak of her game. the service was very fast and efficient. we were back home after an hour and a half and that included the drive over and back."
2013-06-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"my family meets at this restaurant every year for a small reunion. we don't even consider going anyplace else. the food is great, it is the perfect atmosphere, and a convenient location. i think the prices are reasonable for the quality and portions."
2013-06-21,Roxy,4.0,this is our usual dinner after the movie restaurant. the food i always very good and the staff accommodating. a little bit pricey. don't think a lobster has to cost $45
2013-06-18,JL525,5.0,food was fresh as always; service was timely and accurate.
2013-06-16,Susan,5.0,"we had lunch here on father's day, which was very busy. noise level significantly higher than normal, but we expected that. our meals were terrific and wait staff very attentive despite the large crowd. we usually eat here when in framingham and have never been disappointed. wood grilled scallops, nutty salmon, steamers, sides and desserts all top notch."
2013-06-15,L1234,5.0,we enjoyed our evening very much the food was great as usual and would certainly go again
2013-06-13,Nugen,4.0,gods dinner with everyone trying their best to make it a great experience.
2013-06-13,Luv2doWIne,4.0,excellent lunch here with dad. seafood is fresh and delicious and well worth the price. best seafood restaurant in massachusetts. service is attentive and efficient. we will be returning:)
2013-06-11,peterb,4.0,"first time since the new simpler menu. still great choices available, and the soft shell crabs we're great."
2013-06-07,BeautifulDay560,4.0,"our food was delicious. our server was great and friendly. the restaurant was loud on a friday night, but my friend and i could talk without a problem. the host escorted us to our table, and he was very nice as well. my only issue was that i ordered a hot entree to take home to my spouse, and 2 desserts. when they were delivered to our table, they were all tied in one plastic bag, so that the hot food warmed the desserts which were falling apart when i got to my house 2 miles away. the to-go food was delivered prior to bringing our bill, so by the time we got the bill (it took several minutes) and paid it, got out the door and home, the food was all tepid. separate bags and delivery of the bill along with the to-go would have solved this."
2013-06-07,WendyB,5.0,we went to legals natick for our daughters high school graduatiion. legals is a family favorite that we enjoy on special occasions and has become part of our tradition. it was fun to see several other families from our town at the natick restaurent also in celebration of the class of 2013. the food is always good .
2013-06-04,Tommyzaz,5.0,"the lobster, clams, & mussels were fantastic. i recommend the fried clam appetizer."
2013-06-02,Raif,3.0,a reliable place to eat for special dishes. especially the oysters. very nice rolls and a moderate priced wine list. overall though it ain't that great.
2013-06-02,HM1022,5.0,"delicious food. everything i've ever tried has been wonderful, including the drinks. the customer service strives to go above and beyond. i always feel well taken care of and leave happy."
2013-06-01,Stephanie,4.0,food is good and fresh- portions are small
2013-05-30,Outstanding,3.0,"we have eaten at legals many times but our most recent visit was disappointing. at $29, the crab cakes were overpriced, given their small size. the restaurant was very noisy. and the staff had not been well-trained. when we arrived, the host ignored us while he spent several minutes on the phone, apparently taking a message for another employee."
2013-05-29,OpenTable Diner,2.0,there was two of us. my friends meal was no problem mine was not good. the fish was cold and overcooked. i did not tell the waitress until after the meal. not impressed with the presentation. this will not stop me from coming again. i have had great meals before.
2013-05-29,Marie,3.0,"after an unusually long wait, our server took our order. she came back to confirm that i wanted two crab cakes and not single crab cake with scallops and shrimp. the food was brought by another server. what did i get? the single crab cake with shrimp and scallops. my companion did not get the special sauce she ordered. the server muttered, ""what is going on back there?"" everything was rectified quickly, and we went on to enjoy our meal"
2013-05-29,FoodLover,4.0,"i've been to this restaurant 6 times in the past couple of months. the service is consistently excellent, they have good specials and the food is always good."
2013-05-27,August,5.0,always have a good experience here!
2013-05-26,dinnerwithdad,5.0,"consistently good foood and service, which the noise level were down a notch."
2013-05-25,tadamass,5.0,"who knew on a rainy saturday night of memorial weekend, this place would be packed? luckily we had made a 6:30p reservation. what could have been a 90 minute wait turned into a check in breeze through the hungry hordes! seated, we enjoyed a lovely meal and had a great time."
2013-05-22,maddy,5.0,"we love the choices of food, the servers at the bar, which is were we choose to sit...it is always full and vibratn when we are there..."
2013-05-20,SweetSue,5.0,"legal was the first to have a gluten free menu, and unlike other restaurants that offer 2-3 boring gf choices, legal has an entire menu of yummy, savory, terrific meals to choose from. i love that i can get delicious seafood casserole, calamari and a caesar salad that are all delicious and safe to eat. service is a+++"
2013-05-19,picky,3.0,"we eat here often. fish is always fresh. new menue.it was grad nite for local college so it was crowded. but if they take our money they should give better service. oysters came out after salad. long waits for first course.
husband ordered jasmine shrimp w- little cheese & brown rice. came out white rice& sooo much cheese. but we waited so long he would not send it back. new thai veg & shrimp was excellent as we're steamed muscles."
2013-05-19,Guestdining,5.0,guests attending boston convention could easllly find legal sea foods on route 9 and easily return to their hotels afterward. vey comfortable environment great for conversation with relatives. and the food was great. my guest loved the food and the environment and they really enjoyed themselves. sunday lunch or dinner at legal sea foods was a great way to start a convention week.
2013-05-18,Brigit,4.0,i trust the seafood at legal based on what i have read about their testing and i hope the chain never takes this faith away from me. the food is not exciting but consistently good. i wish there were more wild seafood on the menu as i do not eat farmed fish and this severely limits the food i can eat in their restaurants.
2013-05-18,Bruce,4.0,legal's is consistently good in every way.
2013-05-17,LITennisMom,4.0,"first time visiting this legal seafood, but i have been to many other legal seafood restaurants in other towns. we went here with a group of 8, the waiter was attentive and the food as expected was great. everyone at my table loved their main course dishes.. lobster, fried clams, shrimps, fillet and chicken. all of our dishes looked good and tasted even better. the only item that was a bit disappointing was the fried calamari appetizer which was served in quite a small dish and overcooked. we were pleasantly surprised though of the delicious steamed mussels that we had as an appetizer as well. overall we enjoyed our dinner."
2013-05-16,Paix22,5.0,"we ate oysters, trout, shrimp scallops...all was fresh and well cooked. the service was excellent as it always is at legal. we had not been in the area in nearly 2 years...missed legal ..love it -highly recommend. everything from servers to managers care about uests."
2013-05-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"could have been a disaster ...jam packed when we arrived. we had a rez (made 2 hrs prev. via open table). we were told it would be a few minutes & we waited less than 10. apps arrived promptly with fresh rolls. my mom had cioppino which was bigger than her. the waiter generously tied her bib on her even! i had the salmon & they asked me how i wanted it cooked...nothing worse than dry salmon. both were served piping hot. enzo, the manager, was attentive making sure we had a nice experience. considering how amazingly busy they were, i was completely impressed. by the way, for those that think it's expensive...you're prob accustomed to eating fish from thailand/phillipines (red lobster), the walmart of the food world. you get what you pay for."
2013-05-12,foodie,4.0,"upon arrival, the restaurant did not have our reservation on file. i showed them my email confirmation so thankfully they honored it. however the host said this happens with open table quite often where the reservation doesn't show up in their computer. i don't know whether the restaurant was too inundated with so many people being there (i.e. it was mother's day).. they appeared overwhelmed with the crowds of people. i'm thankful that they honored my email. however, we almost didn't get a table. i'm assuming that since we received our 100 points that he eventually found the reservation. maybe there's a glitch in open table with some reservations?"
2013-05-10,Great,5.0,we had such a fantastic meal! we both had to gardent salad to start. i have the swordfish which was the best i have had in a long time. my husband had the fish stuffed with shrimp and he ate every morsal. we both had a delicious dessert. the service was outstanding.
2013-05-09,ILuvGoodFood,5.0,we drive from ct to boston a few of times a year for evening concerts.  eating at legal sea foods always makes the evening doubly special!  wish you had locations in ct!
2013-05-04,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"goodness, the portion sizes of meals were small, especially considering their high prices. we were seated immediately with our reservations for three on a saturday evening. the server was also prompt, knowledgeable, and courteous. my meal of baked stuffed shrimp and broccoli and cheese was ok. the broccoli seemed like it was just warmed - not really cooked or softened at all. and another diner's spinach was so salty she didn't finish it. conversation was also difficult at times due to the noisy environment, despite our being seated in a corner. i would not return there, as you just don't get much for your money."
2013-05-04,DIANA,3.0,the food quality is good but overall the place has become pricey making it only an occasional dining spot. a $10 drink is ridiculous!
2013-05-03,OpenTable Diner,5.0,i had my parents in from out of town they love the chowder and lobster. our 2 children were taken care of as well thank you legalseafoods
2013-05-02,Shermy48,5.0,"the food was excellent, and the service was even better! the server was very knowledgeable and helpful. the manager also made sure to drop by several times to make sure everything was alright.

i was very happy with everything and will definitely dine here again."
2013-04-28,Along4ride,4.0,as always a great meal and a terrific place to go for a night out.
2013-04-24,CraigB,5.0,food is consistent and excellent. good service
2013-04-24,NboroGirl,5.0,"this was my first time there. everything was excellent, from the food to the wine to the service. even if you don't like seafood, the steaks are great. i would go back again."
2013-04-20,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the food at legal seafood was fantastic. everytring is frrsh and cooked to perfection. the service was outstanding. servers are constaly moving. the desert list is lacking somewhat.
2013-04-19,EileenM,4.0,"after bomber lockdown all day, we were in the mood for good food. we were delighted by the crisp, delicious crab cakes with savory sauce and enjoyed the stir fried shrimp,brown rice and vegetables, which can also be ordered vegan. it was poured from a chinese takeout box on to my plate, which was kind of humorous. the salmon was perfectly prepared. our waitress was about the best waitress i've ever had. she had a great sense of humor, much needed after our awful week, and she was extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu. we had a delicious meal after the end of a truly dreadful week, and boy, did we need it."
2013-04-08,FoodLover,5.0,had the clam chowder and baked stuffed lobster. they were both outstanding! and the service was great!
2013-04-06,Kenkoh,5.0,great bar with consistent food and service. manager kevin is friendly and helpful. great local spot!
2013-04-05,Dave,5.0,"excellent seafood; very fresh, and well-prepared."
2013-04-05,FoodieDoc,4.0,"the food is usually good and the staff is usually great. this experience was a little less than avg. i have had better experience with staff and food in the past. our waitress was quite disinterested in us, had no knowledge or guidance with wine. all of our fish was over done. this is not the norm for legal."
2013-04-04,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the bar smelled very moldy or something. almost like a nursing home. not a pleasant place to relax.
2013-04-02,Joanie,3.0,everything good - but too fast - would have liked to relax more before salads and entree out.
2013-03-31,Eattoomuch,5.0,"the food is always good, never disappointed"
2013-03-30,OpenTable Diner,1.0,very expensive for the quality of the food. all meals were so overcooked they were difficult to eat. would not recommend.
2013-03-27,HuzZ,2.0,"service and ambiance was good, however the food was average. the food lacked taste and was very much on the bland side. the quality of their fish was good, but it lacked flavor. maybe i was looking for a bit more spice and kick in their entrees. lunch portions were of good size. the food was out in a timley manner. the place was quiet when i was there, which is good at least during lunch times. its a good spot in framingham, but i was looking for something with a lot more flavor."
2013-03-22,JudithD,4.0,"waitress was wonderful with our 12 year old son who was trying out new menu items. very responsive! food was great. the best part was the warm, yummy rolls!"
2013-03-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"catered very well for the coeliacs in our group with a special menu already prepared. even provided reading glasses for our grandparents who had forgotten their own. service can't be faulted.

food overall was very good though."
2013-03-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great service, super nice. delicious and fresh as usual. sad they didn't have the wine i wanted though."
2013-03-17,fwr3,4.0,maybe it was because it was st. patrick's day maybe because it was a sunday night but the kitchen just kind of threw things together: everything was a little bit off. sure it will be back to it's usual good standards on our next visit. and the oysters were excellent!
2013-03-17,Jennifer,3.0,generally can be counted on for a very good dinner. good spot for families to go before or after a movie.
2013-03-16,OpenTable Diner,4.0,nutty salmon was not great. dry and undersized. haddock was good. service was average.
2013-03-06,diner,4.0,"had a nice table in a quiet spot, good for conversation with a friend. food and service both very good. a favorite spot."
2013-03-03,Foodie,3.0,"salmon was a bit undercooked...i sent it back and it came back not much different, everything else was delicious!"
2013-03-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great food close to home! had surf and turf this trip, and it was fantastic!"
2013-03-01,Atreat2dineout,4.0,we had a wonderful meal and service.
2013-02-28,VisitingfromBoston,5.0,we had a wonderful meal and the service was excellent. i had the wood grilled assortment (my favorite) and my friend had the nutty salmon. i'll be going back soon for a business dinner - can't wait :)
2013-02-27,JenR,4.0,"busy night at the restaurant, but wait staff was amazing - very polished!

overall, food was good. - my husband loved the sashimi tuna -- salmon could have been served hotter..."
2013-02-23,JoyG,5.0,great experience as always. bake stuffed lobster was awesome
2013-02-22,Ellen,5.0,food was great - waiter attentive - gluten free menu always a treat!
2013-02-22,mmechoco,5.0,excellent service and food. the entire staff was very considerate. it was my daughter's birthday and she has a 9 month old. the servers were very considerate and helpful with a child that young.
2013-02-17,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"always excellent food, great for simple grilled fish with interesting and different side dishes."
2013-02-16,cruikne,5.0,our server was one of the best i have ever had!
2013-02-16,capecod2021,5.0,"i don't have a bad thing to say about legal sea foods.  the oysters were amazing, wine terrific, entrees can't be beat.  only a 10 minute wait for our table.  it is not a cheap meal, but always an amazing one."
2013-02-15,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"our experience wasn't horrible, but it wasn't that great either. we had reservations, but they only table they could give us was a small table in the crowded bar area. otherwise we would have had to wait 45 minutes for a regular table. the food was average, which was disappointing because i had expected better based on reputation and price."
2013-02-15,herb,3.0,"it was cold outside but the ac was running sometimes.. we were early, adult group and then later they sat a table with lots of children near us. noisy."
2013-02-15,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"everything was fine, but nothing all that special. the staff at the front desk was friendly and even accommodated us with a later reservation when one of our party was delayed. it was a busy night (valentine's day) and i think that affected how long the food took. my biggest issue was with our waiter, who was impersonal and in attentive. water glasses didn't get filled, wine ran empty, our side dish wasn't ready (yes, that's more of a kitchen issue), and he didn't crack a smile the whole time, despite our friendly and cheerful attitude toward him. so, disappointing service, but decent food."
2013-02-14,MrTVDNR,5.0,food and service was fantastic.
2013-02-14,Diane,5.0,"i am gluten free and our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the gluten free diet; if she wasn't sure she went directly to chef for explanation. my husband laughed because this was the first time in 25 yrs i had a fried seafood dinner!!!!!there was a complete gluten free menu separate from the regular menu; when i questioned choices, the waitress gave me feedback as to what many people on a gluten free menu choose. i was offered hot gluten free rolls which i shared with my husband, who is not gluten free. i do have celiac disease, so this is not a choice i made myself, it is my way of life for the past 25 yrs made for me by my doctor. would definitely return to try something else gluten free that caught my attention; so many choices!"
2013-02-13,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"price & food was excellent

i was looking to spend at least $300 but came out spending only $200."
2013-02-12,HC70,5.0,consistently terrific food and service! and the crab cakes are to die for!!!
2013-02-10,cheffie,4.0,i found it quiite interesting that the manager came by with a complimentary appetizer since we booked on line! i don't know why more people don't take advantage of this. you almost never have to wait.
2013-02-06,herb,4.0,crab cakes were excellent. not to spicy or full or filler
2013-02-06,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"this is a wonderful restaurant, with great staff and beautiful atmosphere. the food is die for, and certainly worth the money. thank you!"
2013-02-04,suzie22,4.0,"i am still thinking about the stuffed shrimp i had, it was delicious and memorable! we hadn't been to legals in a while, after a disappointing experience at the prudential one. however, our meals were delicious, with generous portions, our server polite and prompt and we can't wait to go back!

our only disappointment is that they covered up the fun fish tank in the floor, it was a nice addition to the decor and i guess the cover is scratched?"
2013-02-03,WendyB,5.0,food was great. we were a lively bunch and had a great time. we closed the place down and noone told us to leave. they were very accomodating. we had to change her reservation from 6 to 8 people at the last moment and they took care of it without any hassle or wait.
2013-02-01,Kenn,5.0,always wonderful. you just can't beet legalseafoods for fresh dish or other fare. service at the bar in framingham and most other legalseafoods is superb.
2013-01-29,Jules,3.0,"waiter didn't seem very interested in serving us or our responses to his questions. last question he asked was whether we wanted dessert. we replied no, and then he brought us dessert menus. food was very good, hot, and good portions. am increasingly disappointed that a very good restaurant will suffer from poor service."
2013-01-28,Katie,4.0,"great time, always love legals!"
2013-01-27,AverageDiner,5.0,"it's always busy here but service was prompt and knowledgable. filet was cooked perfectly and the fish eaters were very happy with the rainbow trout and scallops and shrimp. even had dessert, the belgian chocolate parfait with fresh whipped cream was the bomb!"
2013-01-26,Gedalia55,3.0,the noise level was absurd--and mostly coming from the waitstaff in the kitchen. i asked for a quiet table for my 98 yr old mother and i think we got the worst in the house--next to a large group and the kitchen. shame on you legals.
2013-01-26,herb,3.0,"music was awful. loud, clanky, teenage music.

house salad was almost all romaine. did someone mess up and think i ordered ceasar salad?"
2013-01-26,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"meet my mom for dinner, ate in the lounge, it was energetic and fun. food was delicious will head back there, soon."
2013-01-23,Conky,4.0,the food was excellent. the staff was attentive. the ambiance was a little louder than optimal and the lighting was a bit low. on the whole a great experience.
2013-01-22,JoyG,4.0,"staff didn't have my reservation when my friend arrived. i arrived early they showed me to my table nd said they old bring my friend when he arrived...i waited 40minutes when friend arrived she dint think i was there so she was waiting for me. 29 minutes until i called her.. staff did offere desert or appituser but we had lredy ordered. otherwise food was great,"
2013-01-20,skelly,3.0,"been there many times, food always fresh and good. waiter last night was just off. they are usually much better."
2013-01-19,Daisy,3.0,this is a mediocre but very popular restaurant. we had to wait even with a reservation. the food was adequate but nothing special. i've had better seafood at other non-seafood restaurants. the highlight of the evening was our waiter who was attentive & friendly.
2013-01-19,Great,5.0,i had the nutty salmon which was excellent and my husband had the artic chard which he loved! everything was cooked to perfection and our waiter was wonderful.
2013-01-19,Marsha,4.0,"my meal was excellent. haddock, perfectly grilled. baked potato. sauteed spinach. an amazingly busy restaurant, and though the food is excellent, fresh, cooked to perfection, i did ask myself more than once whether the hugely busy ambiance was worth it."
2013-01-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,alwasy fresh fish and quality service
2013-01-18,JoeW,4.0,great service from the waiter carlos he was exceptional... good food and a nice time overall... small mixup when the transponder they gave me did not work and i lost out on a few tables.....
2013-01-18,md7716,3.0,service was a standout. food was so-so.
2013-01-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,my wife and i are at legals at least once a month and we usually sit at the bar and have dinner. bartenders are usually very efficient and friendly. this time we sat in the dining room with our two children and we had a great meal and very good service. food was absolutely perfect.
2013-01-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,food/service is outstanding. noise level much too loud. should have installed noise dampeners in ceiling when restaurant was built.
2013-01-12,katfoodie,3.0,"mostly good food. excellent quality. smaller portions, especially when it comes to appetizers (one crab cake, slightly larger than a fifty-cent piece for an exorbitant sum).

the stuffed shrimp was awful -- 99 percent bread in the stuffing, very little seafood.

all in all a gigantic disappointment.

everything was way too expensive."
2013-01-11,Tracey,5.0,"excellent waiter, perfect timing."
2013-01-10,picky,4.0,"all of our food was great
i had tuna & asked for it rare & it was
cesar salad was very good
they attempted to serve salad in hot( not just slightly warm) soup bowl
i asked for a room temp plate & was brought a cool flat plate. this was perfect & should be standard

i was asked by a manager if all was ok & told him all of the above. he just walked away
dessert egg nog read pudding was only fair. too dry. needed nutmeg or something more"
2013-01-07,Bobt,4.0,consistently excellent. fresh fish cooked perfectly.
2013-01-06,OpenTable Diner,2.0,the food was not that good. service was ok but slow and she forgot some things.
2013-01-03,Mick,5.0,"excellent quality food. i was impressed. i have not eaten there much, thinking it was overrated and expensive. i was wrong. it's well worth it."
2012-12-31,OpenTable Diner,2.0,busiest night for dining out. food was overcooked! shrimp stuffing like wallpaper paste and not tasty. poor value for cost. won't dine there again!
2012-12-30,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"love legals, always have, and always will. consistently super!"
2012-12-30,Disappointed,2.0,"the fish is super fresh, the side dishes were mediocre. onion strings were boring, and french fries were too salty."
2012-12-30,JoeBagodonuts,4.0,"i was impressed with their attention to details that we left using our opentable reservation... of the 4 people in our dinner party, 2 had different allergies and the hosts & servers were especially attentive to those needs - just from my mention of them when i made the reservation.
the food was not spectacular, but was perfectly acceptable."
2012-12-28,OpenTable Diner,2.0,overpriced....over rated.....small portions....salad size was a joke
2012-12-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we loved the ambiance of the place. the sauteed mussels and seafood casserole were delicious. the kids menu had some very unique choices, which we loved. customer service was the best we have seen, and we would love to come back and try some of the other recipes. overall, a great dining experience on a very special occasion."
2012-12-25,LisaM,5.0,"great time! great food and unbelievable customer service. everyone from the host station to the servers etc were so attentive. i even saw the manager help an elderly person to the car.

great night!"
2012-12-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,i took my 90 yr. old aunt who just moved here from chicago. i have listened to her complain about our local food and no flavor. not this time she really enjoyed it and was very happy. when she's happy it makes me happy. we'll return soon!
2012-12-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews! have been to leagal many times, but has been at least a year since last visit.
did not get the complimentary appetizer as other reviews had noted if you made a reservation. we ordered bluefish appetizer, very good. food hot, and delicious! the size or portion i felt was fine and my co-diners felt the same. only one problem the pumpkin cheesecake topping was still frozen or not at room temperature other wise the cheesecake was delicious and other deserts were also delicious.
all personnel were friendly!
would return in the future for dinner."
2012-12-21,RobM,5.0,"had a great lunch, food and service was excellent."
2012-12-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we went here for a nearby, mid-week anniversary dinner and were pleased with the food and service. we were not expecting a quiet, romantic experience just because this is a family/group oriented place, but were not disappointed either - we had a small table in one of the more quiet spots in the restaurant. our server, omar was very attentive and made us feel very welcome. the host even remembered our anniversary when we left."
2012-12-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always a great experience. best seafood around.
2012-12-12,FatRat250,5.0,"food was very good - glad to have the bluefish pâté, and the clam chowder was thick and full of clams. i had sautéed scallops which were very good, but not great. my server, cal, was excellent, attentive and on the ball."
2012-12-08,OpenTable Diner,3.0,oysters and cocktails were amazing! dinners specials not so good.
2012-12-08,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food and service wad great. friendly and went out of their way. the manager made a visit to the table early on and later asking how it was and making sure it was a great dining experience. i was on a date and would return againm
2012-12-03,LikeItalian,4.0,food is good and predictable. i had a salad and a cup of chowder.
2012-12-02,AdamS,3.0,first time at this restaurant. the food was good but i wasn't blown away. the shrimp and scallops weren't that great. i expected better. the steak was good but overall not sure that i would go back.
2012-12-02,loyal14,4.0,food always great just took a little too long
2012-12-01,Henry,4.0,"tasty seafood--albeit somewhat small portions; efficient, friendly service; downtown-like prices; tables crowded together; a bit noisy."
2012-12-01,LeilaC,4.0,"i had the hake entree special and it was a lovely surprise. the hake filet was moist and cooked to perfection, and the accompaniment was a delicious combination.
my husband had the fresh bay scallops special, seared, which were also delicious, although the side dishes were nothing exciting.
our server chad was very helpful and very attentive."
2012-11-29,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"parking was difficult...we had to walk a country mile! using open table was an easy way to make reservations...thanks. food was good though not great. having said that, i fou d the prices outrageous and service just ok."
2012-11-26,gigi,5.0,"really love the gluten free options! terrific, delicious, and thank you......"
2012-11-24,David,2.0,"oddly, non-entrees (bluefish pâté, seaweed salad, ice cream bonbons) were very good, but grilled fish and shellfish combo was overcooked and not all that flavorful. service was a cut below the chain's boston flagship, though not terrible."
2012-11-22,Phoodee,5.0,"always fresh and consistent. pricey, but worth it."
2012-11-22,MichelleD,5.0,we were there for thanksgiving; the staff made it a truly festive and special meal.
2012-11-22,gardengal4,4.0,"normally, i would rate this restaurant a 5, but i was especially disappointed with the size of the lobster i received. it was supposed to be 1.50-1.75, but it was a pound or barely over a pound imo. plus, one claw was a partial dud on the meat content (which can happen sometimes, i understand). for the inflated price, i expect much more in the way of size. other than that, service was great, portions good. the other folks loved their meals (crabcakes and the thanksgiving turkey special). although i am not especially a fan on boston creme pie, we all decided to get it for desert and it was out of this world."
2012-11-22,Monkeemom,4.0,"our server was excellent in recommending drinks, food and dessert. the only thing i didn't like about was how they seat people. there are plenty of tables in one area but people are stuffed in one corner."
2012-11-18,Sophia,4.0,"hadn't been here in a while, even tough we're nearby.. food and service were outstanding ! we will be back soon !"
2012-11-18,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great food and good service. we took our 1 year old and 5 year old and they also enjoyed the food from the kids menu.
2012-11-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,everything was fine except it was busy & noisy -- normal for a popular spot on a saturday night.
2012-11-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"fantastic experience with my server, omar who did not only exceed my expectations, but offered suggestions making the evening one of the best ever."
2012-11-10,4craj,5.0,it was a great choice for our 17th anniversary. we had a great server who was very personable and professional.
2012-11-10,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"excellent oysters, excellent fish, good service!"
2012-11-09,CRLboston,5.0,they are making an effort to reclaim their name as the best seafood restaurant. big improvement from my last visit a few months ago
2012-11-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great food as usual, had the bisque and then scrod, glad they brought back the baked potato. my husband is still waiting for them to bring back the snap peas with oyster sauce, he misses them. we also had a chefs tasting sample brought over because we had made a reservation, it was a crostini with bacon and pineapple with a chipotle mayo, it was very good and a nice tpuch. our waitress was very good, attentive when needed and away when needed."
2012-11-08,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"looked forward to my lunch of grilled swordfish salad on nov. 8. what i got was a tasty but truly miniscule portion of fish, less than 1/2 inch thick, x 5""l x 3w"". and this for $17.00? i didn't make a fuss as this was a business lunch with a client, at my invitation."
2012-11-05,LikeItalian,4.0,food was good and service very attentive.
2012-11-04,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the food was good as always. service was slow and several items were missing or short. i needed to prompt the server and corrections were made promptly. someone from the kitchen came out and apologized for the delays. free desert and one appetizer was removed from the bill which was appreciated.
2012-11-02,FatRat250,4.0,"back to the usual good food after my not do great meal at legals in peobody 3 days prior. they put the bluefish pâté on the specials list - please bring this back for good! chowder was good. special grilled fish player was ok but not great. swordfish was dry, scallops were sandy. waiter - steve - was excellent."
2012-10-27,cheffie,4.0,we had a thoroughly nice time and would recommend it. it's not often that the waiter really makes the dinner wibderful!
2012-10-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,another exceptional meal with my family. thank you.
2012-10-23,Dick,5.0,i had a visitor from a foreign country and he absolutely loved the chowder and the cioppino
2012-10-21,DanielM,5.0,always a great dining experience.
2012-10-19,SherryC,4.0,"i was surprised at how good the food was this time. i've been many times before and was frankly, never overly impressed, given the prices. this time i really thought the food was great and the service was very good too. had calamari, steamed wontons and the sole."
2012-10-16,kfbooks,4.0,"the food & service was great bit it was so loud in the dining room that our server had trouble hearing our orders, and we had trouble hearing each other."
2012-10-14,EvaK,4.0,my husband and i have eaten here many times . we enjoy getting cherry stone clams as an appetizer. i didn't see them on the menu but our waiter said that they were available. when we got them the clams were too big.
2012-10-11,Steve,5.0,"we had a lovely dinner to celebrate our anniversary. the food was wonderful and the service was terrific.
we were very pleased."
2012-10-06,joycec,5.0,we had great food and a great waitress!
2012-10-06,OpenTable Diner,2.0,i think maybe just a bad night. will have to try one more time to give a good review.
2012-10-05,LegalFan,5.0,"wonderful dinner experience with my fiancee from start to finish. it was our first time at this particular location but we had been to others so we knew the food would be good. we were brought to our table at the exact time of our reservation. the waiter was outstanding. he was prompt, friendly, very helpful with the menu, and checked on us the right amount of times. we had a complimentary sample of an appetizer not featured on the menu brought out to us before our meals, which was unexpected and delicious. food was impeccable as usual. we plan on returning here frequently!"
2012-10-05,MargaretM,5.0,thought it was very good. all the wait staff were excellent and very attentive. the food was also very good. had a great evening.
2012-10-04,GoodfoodAwesomeService,5.0,patrick the manager made sure that everything was perfect. the wait staff was excellent and the food perfect. i would highly recommend it.
2012-09-28,LawrenceG,3.0,an ok restaurant. servers tried their best to make us comfortable and were very attentive.
2012-09-26,sally,2.0,there are few places in metro west worth being recommended for the kind of quality we used to find.couple of places in wellesley and wellesley hills better than average. outstanding for what it ofered....gone way down in many ways.legle used to be
2012-09-26,Great,4.0,great place in the metro boston area to get seafood.
2012-09-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"this was definitely one of the best dining experiences we've had in a long time. our waiter was exceptional. he was well informed, polite, there when we needed him but allowed us time to work through our meal at our own pace. leandro was definitely very good at his job. to our surprise we were greeted by the manager with a special appetizer when we arrived. it was definitely a treat. my only request for the future would be the option to do a 1/2 plate. my meal was delicious but portion was rather large."
2012-09-20,Paulspin,2.0,"not that impressed with what i ordered to be honest. the calamari i was told was 'incredible' it was average fried calamari nothing more, nothing less. i then had baked shrimp which i found stodgy, dry and utterly underwhelming.

service was also quite odd. the server was a inattentive and walked off when we spoke with her on more than one occasion.

i won't be returning in a hurry."
2012-09-20,Ellen,5.0,as always outstanding fish and excellent service. for people with celiac disease it is one of the few you never have to worry - they get it!
2012-09-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,this was the first time we used open table for a reservation and it worked out perfectly. we only had to wait a few minutes for our table and ended up having a great seat. the atmosphere was terrific and the food was delicious!
2012-09-15,kk28,3.0,its legal what more can you say....
2012-09-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,our server and visits from the managers made our visit feel that we were the most important guests in the restaurant. my guests were more than impressed. enjoyed the hustle and bustle. food and atmosphere where spectacular.
2012-09-14,GablesGirlLikesHerFood,3.0,"the management checked on us twice, and the waitress was thorough and attentive, however there were a few flaws. my baked stuffed shrimp tasted like something i'd find in the frozen foods aisle at the grocery store. everyone else's meals were just okay. our waitress was nice, however, she spent too much time discussing the wine special of the night. after everyone at the table ordered mixed drinks or beer, she followed up the wine lecture at the end of the night by inviting us to sign up for the weekly email updates b/c we would get an invitation to meet some wine conneseur and free wine tasting. she talked about it for at least 5 minutes, when it was clear that no one at the table was interested in wine. truly a waste of the guests' time."
2012-09-14,ConcordGolfer,4.0,"service was suitably attentive without hovering (!) food was fresh and tasty.
a very enjoyable lunch."
2012-09-08,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"immediately after being seated we were brought a special, complementary appetizer to thank us for making a reservation. food was good (as it always is) and service was attentive, but not to the level that you feel that you are being rushed."
2012-09-03,Jimbo,2.0,the old gray mare ain't what she used to be - come on - you gotta be able to make an appetizing fish & chips. yuk!
2012-08-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we always love coming here from some good seafood, and with some family members visiting, we had to come again. the service was exceptional. even though one member arrived late, the waitress offered to keep her chowdah warm, or even to scoop her a new bowl once she arrived. the raw sampler (treasures of the sea) was amazing. another favorite is the wildfire grilled sampler. tonight, the fish was a little on the overlooked sized, but still delicious. i have to say the scallops weren't cooked that great, and were a bit mushy. the biggest complaint i have is that they don't offer the old salt ale, a special beer that harpoon used to brew especially for legals. oh well. overall a great experience and great food."
2012-08-30,SirJ,4.0,"food excellent. service excellent.

but i had asked for a quiet spot, and we were next to a rowdy group, so had to move."
2012-08-28,Bostonfinner,4.0,"after a summer of travel and beaches, we were all (six) very happy to meet for dinner at legals. the menu changes but the quality, presentation and service remain constant. we are long time fans - right from inman square - and remain very happy diners."
2012-08-25,Eattoomuch,4.0,pretty good food. service was exceptionally good.
2012-08-24,picky,4.0,"good
wine prices seem to have gone up"
2012-08-19,NancyM,4.0,"legal's is legal's is legal's.  my grilled scallops and shrimps were excellent.  my husband's halibut, although expertly cooked, was ""boring"" according to him.  i guess the sauce did not adequately infuse the fish, or at least, not as much as he'd like.  as we age, we like the noise level less and less."
2012-08-18,Legalfan,4.0,repeat customer - food is always fabulous!
2012-08-18,Smth755,4.0,typical ok legals never a surprise
2012-08-12,Miya,5.0,seafood quality was excellent as usual but what really stood out this time was the service. our server was excellent.
2012-08-11,HerbF,4.0,mussel appetizer was terrific as was the scrod. expensive but worth it for special occasion dinner.
2012-08-11,Rick,2.0,food took 40 minutes to be delivered to our table.
2012-08-08,PatOK,4.0,great seafood. not much selection for fish frowners. efficient & friendly service.
2012-08-08,OpenTable Diner,5.0,overall experience was exceptional. the servers paid attention to every detail and were extremely polite. the food was outstanding and we even received a free appetizer. they were generous enough to accommodate my request to sit in a booth for my wife's birthday. i would recommend this place to anyone who wants a real dinning experience.
2012-08-07,MattL,3.0,nice spot for a get together with friends. food was fairly sub par for the prices; my fish was over done as was my wife's. good calamari though. can't recommend given the food issue.
2012-08-06,Eric,1.0,"we waited over an hour for salads. when we arrived we were among the only diners. they appear to have lost our order. my friends requested gluten-free rolls, which arrived frozen."
2012-08-04,SueL,4.0,"although the food was delicious and well prepared, our waiter was less than friendly. he almost seemed annoyed by our party of 8 adults. the hostess who seated us was very nice and energetic. she would have been a much better server."
2012-08-02,deep6oysters,4.0,"as usual, the oysters were divine - served impeccably fresh on a bed of crushed ice.  chowder excellent.  nice sangria!  lovely hot rolls!  we always enjoy the legal restaurants."
2012-07-31,Diner,3.0,i went to lunch in the framingham location on a beautiful sunny day. the restaurant itself is rather dark so we asked to sit in the bar where at least they have windows. the tables are all with high stools (it is a bar) so it is not particularly comfortable to eat a meal. i was very disappointed in the food - not at all distinguished.
2012-07-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,really great seafood!! we arrived 20 minutes before our reservation and they took us right to a table.
2012-07-29,Foodie,3.0,"waitr staff seemed to want us out quickly.

she seemed hurried."
2012-07-29,Patriciony,4.0,"great menu, you can really taste the fresh seafood"
2012-07-29,DinerK754,3.0,"i much prefer legal c bar and legal harborside to this location.  good for lunch while at the mall, but not my first choice when selecting a dinner location."
2012-07-28,Henry,4.0,dependable seafood; attentive staff; crowded seating; high-ish prices for suburbs.
2012-07-25,MichaelG,4.0,"the one comment i would make is there needs to be better co-ordination between the
waiters and the kitchen. specifically, this comment is related to the availability
of certain foods. at the time the first course was to be delivered, we were told that
the restaurant had run out of the type of oyster we had ordered, so that one of our
party was served, while the three of us had to wait for the substitute oysters. the
same thing happened with the main course, when three people were served, the fourth
person was informed you had run out of bluefish."
2012-07-23,azlu,5.0,an excellent afternoon. four of us each ordered a different item and all were outstanding. service was great as well.
2012-07-21,Rachel,5.0,a little noisy. our server was great - gave good recommendations but not too pushy.
2012-07-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the entrees was delicious however the sides were somewhat lackluster.
wines were top notch."
2012-07-18,drhc,4.0,great service and food taste and quality. especially helpful in attending to 4-year old who does have very good restaurant manners.
2012-07-16,Sandypo,4.0,our dinner was excellent and the staff was great but the restaurant is very noisy and sometimes its hard to hear the people sitting opposite you!
2012-07-16,Bceagle,5.0,"as always great food
had double stuffed shrimp
amazing"
2012-07-11,OpenTable Diner,3.0,nice meal but very loud and hard to hear the group of people i was meeting.
2012-07-05,John,3.0,"we have been there many times and the food is always fresh and good. but for what one gets, many items are overpriced. i had the softshell crab appetizer and it was good, albeit a smaller crab than i have been used to. it was served on a nice arugula salad. then i had the crabcake dinner for about $29. it too came with an arugula salad, also good. but that was all it came with! no starch to help achieve hunger satisfaction! i was hungry and very disappointed. if you go there, you must question what is included in the dinners and choose wisely or you may go away hungry, despite a final tab of $158 for 2 people, including drinks and dessert (necessary because of the lack of sustenance at dinner)."
2012-07-01,Dchiari13,5.0,"amazing food and incredible service, they made a tourist like me feel at home"
2012-06-30,Atreat2dineout,5.0,"we had an amazing meal and even more amazing service from our waiter, serge."
2012-06-23,Mike,5.0,"as usual, wonderful selection... the ""lite"" clam chowder was amazing. the wood grill assortment is always a surprise worth waiting for... this time; tuna, shrimp, and swordfish. all perfectly grilled."
2012-06-23,Purpleskier,5.0,"the food was quite good, but the service was the best! chad was a great waiter and we had two different managers come up and talk with us, despite the place being very busy. we also were given a sample appetizer, which was very nice!"
2012-06-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"knowledgable, professional wait staff, very accurate and helpful, but slow and disappear for long periods of time."
2012-06-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,my experience here was solid. everything went smoothly and the food was good. can't ask for much more.
2012-06-22,LilyM,2.0,"found the food rather bland. not as good as when it first opened years ago. only went because we received gift certificate. not on our top restaurants to visit. presentation not as nice either.

one of the entrees (swordfish) was overlooked and had to be returned."
2012-06-17,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great time overall from the food, wait staff, ambiance, prices, etc. we had our 5-year-old with us and she had fun coloring the pages they gave her and the kids' menus wasn't the typical garbage you see at restaurants and was overall healthy and priced accordingly. we can't wait to go back. ask for kevin."
2012-06-16,drhc,5.0,joined family for a fu delicious meal. wait staff was very attentive.
2012-06-08,OpenTable Diner,3.0,not smart to serve appetizers even bring entrees while children aged 6 and 8 had no food brought to the table.
2012-06-07,CFLGlobal,5.0,excellent food and service. the apetizer was reall good especially the raw cherry stone and oysters. maine lobster was superb. the waiter go the extra distance to please my guests.

2012-06-04,Geoff,4.0,"just a consistently good experience... our waitress was a delightful young woman, friendly, helpful, committed to our dining pleasure. she went beyond merely good at her job to exceptionally nice and conversationally thoughtful to us. she elevated our meal to memorable. can we clone her?"
2012-06-03,fwr3,4.0,always enjoy the meal - don't usually enjoy the noise level
2012-06-02,NancyP,5.0,"enjoyed our meal. we both had the catch of the day and it was excellent. they served a good martini and had plenty of wines by the glass. we had bananas foster for dessert, too bad it was not flaming. waiter was terrific, very enthusiastic with good recommendations."

2012-05-19,Suzano,4.0,"great food, enjoy sitting in bar area for more of a vibrant experience.  dining area is more quiet."
2012-05-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"perfection! i am so picky about crabcakes, i rarely order them, as i judge them based on the awesome ones i make myself! your crabcakes are far better than mine! (never thought i would ever say that!)."
2012-05-10,Kristine,4.0,food was great and our waitress was very helpful and nice!
2012-05-09,MATT,3.0,"my wife had boston scod and i had grilled mediterranean salmon, the taste was good. but my wife had a small plastic wrapping in her meal and waitress and restaurant manager apologized for it. good place for seafood but watch out your meal's ""ingredients"" :)"
2012-05-06,Cesare,3.0,"unfortunately the service was very slow! we did not order a beverage until we had been seated for 15-20minutes. also had to wait long intervals for beverage and finally some bread was served- long wait for main entree- disappointing! think that our server was ""working"" too many tables!"
2012-05-05,Legalfan,5.0,always delicious

2012-05-01,CrabLover,4.0,"i love the seafood at this place, would highly recommend the seafood casserole."
2012-04-28,Speg75,4.0,"the food never disappoints - but the noise level in this restaurant can be overwhelming at times. luckily, we were seated in an area that could be used as a function room, so the noise level was tolerable. at first, they tried to seat us at the bar (without asking) and asked if we could be moved elsewhere. the bar is really, really noisy - and some folks like it that way. again - food was great - service was a little slow."
2012-04-28,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"our table was ready right when promised. and the food was excellent as usual. however, we sat at 6:00 and with my daughter being 5, we wanted to be finished eating around 7. our food did not even arrive until after 7, which was disappointing because we really enjoy eating at legals, but she was tired before her meal arrived."
2012-04-26,FoodForThought,2.0,legals is no longer the great seafood restaurant of the past. it is now too expensive with restaurant chain mediocre food. we had fried clams that were on the soggy side making them seem like they were reheated. the tuna was tough and the waitperson never asked what sauce we wanted. i have had the same experience on prior occasions at other locations.
2012-04-26,jtwrevo,3.0,i asked for a quiet booth and got a loud open table in the main area. waiter was pompous and lacked personality. food was good.
2012-04-22,BMAC48,5.0,"this was an early dinner after movie. excellent mixed seafood grill; mussels just done right; staff checked and made sure all was done properly for person with seafood allergies. desserts choc mousse fine; fruit mousse excellent;
friendly and efficient staff, nice ambiance"
2012-04-22,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the chef sent out a special appetizer just because we made reservations on open table. that was a cool surprise.
2012-04-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,good food. very loud crowd. long wait between courses.
2012-04-16,momof2boys,5.0,"we had an awesome post boston marathon celebration! our waiter was terrific- knowledgable, attentive, and personable. several staff members congratulated my husband (the runner) and they threw in dessert for free."

2012-04-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"very good food. had a wonderful waitress. got a free appetizer for reserving through opentable, which was absolutely fantastic!

funny: a silly little fish going around and around the large fish tank the whole time we were there—about 2.5 hours!"
2012-04-07,RichardfromKennebunk,4.0,"consistently fine seafood at reasonable prices.
great david bruce cab"
2012-04-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the ""azores: menu was very interesting!"
2012-04-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"holly, our server last night was great, very attentive and made good menu recommendations. we eat here at least 6-8 times per month, and enjoy it. it is our go-to restaurant for fish and seafood, in an off-cape location."
2012-04-06,foodie,5.0,we had wonderful tuna and a great waitress!
2012-04-05,Newguy,5.0,"everything was very, very good - the food, the service and the setting. my only comment was that as the room filled up it got pretty noisy."
2012-03-31,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the menu deteriorated in the few years, no more exotic or special fish, just plain salmon, trout etc. just plain sea food restaurant, nothing more. the service is a bright spot in the restaurant and quality of food is good, but selection is poor."
2012-03-30,Trish,3.0,"we were seated in a back area of the restaurant. small room and last table in the room.
no ambiance at all. was very disappointed. food was ok. ordered a bottle of wine and we
ended up filling our glasses every time. will not go back. also went to the bar after dinner for a cocktail and the staff never even bothered to wait on us. they seemed to busy cleaning up to go home then to attend to us customers. it was only 9:45 at the time."
2012-03-27,TravelingDiner,5.0,"service and food excellent.  very accommodating to my need for gluten free selections, especially good gluten free rolls.  somewhat noisy and difficult to have a conversation."

2012-03-10,Albert2,4.0,"my raw oysters and steamed mussels were the best. service was perfect. found the noise level very high. food was expensive, but worth it."

2012-03-09,gigi,3.0,thank you for your attention to my gluten free needs!
2012-03-04,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great, fresh food. excellent service and a nice atmosphere."
2012-02-24,Boston661,4.0,"food was great as always but these palm pilot things the waitresses use to record your order led to details being missed. steamed garlic broccoli became steamed broccoli. broccoli with cheese (someone else ordered) became just broccoli. they did do a very good job taking care of someone in our party who had celiacs and required gluten free. out waitress was a little slow and had a smug personality, but usually we get great service and food there."
2012-02-24,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"i have been in the one in boston harbor while traveling. in that one you would not be left with the feeling that you're having lunch in a 'seafood chain restaurant'.
not so much with this one. the fish scent welcomes you when you open the door, and not in a good way...everything seemed much less fresh than i remembered. red lobster like?"
2012-02-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,everything that came out of the kitchen was excellent...the service was prompt and courteous. the manager came over to our table in order to wish my wife a happy birthday. her dessert was on the house. overall an excellent experience.
2012-02-22,CharlesC,5.0,"used for business meeting, very appropriate!!!"
2012-02-19,CraigB,5.0,great food and service - can always count on legals for a nice meal.
2012-02-19,RafaelS,5.0,"one of my favorite restaurants in the natick area, food is always delicious, service is always great. one little piece of advice, make reservations. this place is very popular and always has a waiting time."
2012-02-17,Boston661,4.0,"my expectations of chains are low, but legals really is great. the quality is high, the service is the best anywhere, and you can have a healthy and tasty meal customized to your liking."
2012-02-16,AndreaP,5.0,"i loved my experience here. it was great especially how well everyone treated us, specifically the host stand. they were great by seating us right at our reservation time and very attentive. the service at the table was also fantastic. our server made some great suggestions for us to try, and we loved them all!"
2012-02-14,NotHappy,5.0,food was very good and the serivce was excellent!
2012-02-12,mommy77,4.0,food was good except the kids pizza a was dry.
2012-02-12,Massfoodie,4.0,the consistent excellence never ceases to amaze me. we had baked oysters and seared tuna apps. main courses were crabmeat stuffed sole and arctic char (back after a long absence). hope to have the butterfish again sometime - yum! a great reasonably priced white wine finished at all off in style. thanks again!
2012-02-12,Greatescaper,3.0,"the appetizers were great we had blackened tuna, and oysters on the half shell. my scallop casserole was over cooked and i was surprised that the scallops used were bay scallops! maybe i missed this on the menu, but i was expecting big juicy sea scallops. my husband had crab legs that were supposed to have a fruit salsa but came with something that looked like sweet and sour sauce from a jar. not worth the price."
2012-02-11,Great,5.0,"our waiter and the food were fantastic. i had the nutty salmon which was out of this world, my husband had the baked scallops which he loved. one of our friends had the gray sole which he said was the best he had ever had and his wife had the shrimp which she raved about.
i had requested a booth which they honored but we had to wait a little while since it was very crowded but then again it was the saturday before valentine's day. the wait was certainly worth it due to the delicious dinner had by all."
2012-02-11,OpenTable Diner,4.0,food was fine and the service excellent. our waitress was great! the noise level made it hard to talk.
2012-02-10,Gary,5.0,our server was outstanding tonight.
2012-02-10,NHavenluvot,5.0,"you can never go wrong. great service, great food."

2012-01-29,JohnD,5.0,"the waiter from africa, olmar was simply perfect. he was very proactive and professional. i told the management that i will want him only. he makes the experience enjoyable due to his service."
2012-01-26,SusieQ,5.0,"we were celebrating my husband's birthday with children and young grandchildren. the waiters were considerate, helpful, patient and kept checking to see if anything was needed. the food was delicious and the the fish fresh as always. legals is a great restaurant for large parties (we were 11) of all ages."
2012-01-26,GoodfoodAwesomeService,5.0,"do a great job and the food is excellent. try the ""tuna everything"" - made like an everything bagel - excellent."
2012-01-21,sibud,2.0,very loud and they rush you
2012-01-20,Koreander,5.0,"legals is one of the few ""chains"" you can go to where the food is consistently excellent and you will always have a terrific dining experience. legals makes the best crabcakes -- not bready and full of delicious crabmeat. service is attentive and impeccable."
2012-01-15,Winni,4.0,"service was a bit rushed. it wasn't busy when we arrived, but it filled up. server grabbed our plates as soon as we put down our forks (or before) and grabbed the bill before we even had a chance to look at it."
2012-01-14,SueL,5.0,food was fresh and prepared as requested. we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though the restuarant was packed.
2012-01-14,LarryO,4.0,"we were a table of 5. the food was excellent (it's always been excellent), wood grilled haddock, grilled salmon, and one lone filet mignon. we had fried calamari and crab cakes as appetizers and both were excellent. the main dishes came out cooked perfectly, even the med rare filet was exactly as ordered. a nice bottle of wine, not terribly expensive and an extremely attentive and helpful waiter (steve c). steve did a wonderful job, informative, attentive, but not intrusive."
2012-01-14,BernB,4.0,"very good food, always dependable."
2012-01-13,OpenTable Diner,5.0,graat food consistently. awesome bananas foster!
2012-01-12,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great for a special occasion, as good seafood tends to be pricey."
2012-01-07,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great for diners with food allergies, including gluten-free. much appreciated."
2012-01-05,PatOK,4.0,"menu offers a wide variety of high quality seafood and fish items. every dish was prepared excellently and our server was efficient and courteous. their computer system was down during the busy lunch hours, but they worked through the problem. the bill and credit card receipts had to be hand-written but the management had delegated the resourced necessary to do this without slowing down the payment process. only issue is a pretty limited selection for those of us who don't eat fish or seafood, but that's not a surprise to us."
2012-01-03,Escargot,4.0,always consistant.  that's why it's worth the wait.
2012-01-01,OpenTable Diner,2.0,we made reservations and were put in the bar. we had people standing within inches of us that made it difficult to enjoy. serving size was small. i've been here in the past but will not return.
2011-12-31,drhc,4.0,"service and food quality excellent, not rushed yet very attentative for a pre-new year's eve dinner in the early evening"
2011-12-31,TerryD,5.0,i found the food delicious and so did my party. we will definitely return.

2011-12-29,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent service and the food was great. the timing of the appetizers and the dinner were spaced well. our waitress was very friendly. we had a great time.
2011-12-28,oldgolfer27,4.0,"the food was exceptional. our party of four enjoyed salmon, mahi, swordfish and crab cakes, all prepared perfectly. our waitress was friendly, knowledgable and prompt. not one water glass hit bottom, even though the restaurant was crowded.
our only complaint was waiting for a table. we had a reservation for 7:45 and didn't get seated until after 8. as seinfeld said, anyone can take a reservation; the important thing is holding the reservation."
2011-12-28,Denbrook,5.0,"this was a celebration of our 49th wedding anniversary and the flowers i ordered were on the table when we were shown to the booth by the manager who specifically set it aside for us, despite a very busy, crowded night. great time, and great service!"
2011-12-25,LisaR,5.0,very good food and service. was very happy to have a good place to go for christmas. they served the whole menu!
2011-12-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent meals and appetizers across the board for the 4 of us even for one in our group who doesn't eat fish. the seaweed side dish was a pleasant change of pace for veggie choice.

2011-12-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always consistantly excellent

2011-12-03,MarkS,5.0,love eating here. the wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. we prefer the bar area.
2011-11-30,gigi,5.0,great waiter!!! thanks for gluten free service!
2011-11-28,Trixie,3.0,very expensive and lots of pushing from waiter to order more food and drink. some entrees good but tuna wasabi bland and clam chowder lukewarm.
2011-11-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the lobster was excellent. i had the gluten-free rolls which were very tasty. everyone came over and ask us if everything was good a few times. they made us feel very special.
2011-11-26,RaquelV,4.0,"always a great choice for us, from the youngest in the family (5yrs old) to the oldest (73yrs). this particular legal seafoods always has food to appeal to each, and is capable of providing child friendly environment or a spot for a romantic evening!"
2011-11-24,OpenTable Diner,3.0,nice place to go for thanksgiving.
2011-11-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"thanksgiving day was open and perfect alternative for those too tired to cook. great turkey dinner, good kid's menu and outstanding service. carlos was the best.
two in our party forgot turkey day and ordered seafood. very good experience."

2011-11-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"as always, the best sea food."
2011-11-19,TMS5,5.0,great server and service. wine list is impressive as usual. restaurant well catered to one of our party member's gluten intolerance.
2011-11-19,JudyS,4.0,"the food was great. however when we entered the small room in the back in was freezing from the air conditioning and very uncomfortable. the waitress sais the a/c was shut off, but it was only shut off after our meals were done. i had to eat with my coat on. therfore, the food got cold quickly."
2011-11-12,foodie,4.0,thumbs up except we asked the waitress if the calamari could be grilled. about ten minutes later it arrived (although we hadn't ordered it) we think she just wanted to turn the table over quickly.
2011-11-11,OpenTable Diner,4.0,perfectly cooked seafood. slow service. fairly expensive.
2011-11-05,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"everything was perfect!!!!
we had a six thirty reservation, and were taken right away.
it was our friends birthday, and the waiter and all the staff were so attentive. they all made it a very special and pleasurable evening!!!"
2011-11-04,Anna,2.0,"i don't really understand why people like this place so much. i've been a couple of times, the food is bland, the atmosphere boring and the service is ok but nothing to write home about."
2011-11-03,rjsr,5.0,too many legal spaces are noisy.
2011-11-02,EngagedFriendlyDiner,2.0,"we had a 7:00 pm reservation but had to wait twenty minutes for a table. the table we got was the one closest to the entrance to the kitchen – and right next to a party of twelve, including two very loud toddlers. when we asked for another table, we were told it would be another twenty minutes. we sat down.
the female server was very obsequious, she fawned all over as we ordered and then disappeared to serve larger parties around us. we waited – and waited – ten minutes before asking her to please bring our wine, then another ten before asking her for our appetizers.
all the food was delicious, but with a terrible table and annoying server – we’ll not go back."
2011-10-31,CraigB,5.0,awesome experience and service was even better than the typical high standards for legals.
2011-10-28,JOANNR,5.0,"we sat at the bar and the service was great. they were friendly and attentive, but not over-bearing. food was fanatastic. fresh, delicious oysters."

2011-10-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,they should put back the baked potato as a side dish in the menu.
2011-10-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the food was really good. we were seated in a booth it was very noisy. the kitchen was behind us.
2011-10-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the wood grilled mahi mahi with black beans & rice and pesto was superb! attentive, professional service. terrific date night locale!"
2011-10-18,picky,5.0,"waitress was outstanding.
i had maple flavor spiced shrimp specioal of the day. sounded odd, but the maple gave the sweetness to balance the spice."
2011-10-15,bubbe,5.0,they seated us write away. the service was great. we had one person in our party thats hard-of hesring and it was way too noisey for him. the food was very good.
2011-10-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent food - best seafood anywhere, anytime, excellent service."
2011-10-07,Lori,4.0,"food and wine were excellent, as always."
2011-09-29,JohnF,3.0,legal has always been very good choice for dinner but lately just been average - not bad by any means but not as good as it use to be.
2011-09-24,Debooinma,2.0,unfortunately they lost our credit card between the table and checking out so we are dealing with a satisfactory outcome.
2011-09-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,management most accomodating in providing private dining facilities with exceptional server and food preparation staff.
2011-09-19,TrentS,4.0,great service. knowledgeable staff. legal is very accomodating to gluten allergies.
2011-09-16,Dyana,3.0,the seafood is fresh but the prices are outrageous. a glass of house wine is ridiculous and all in all it's just not a great value.
2011-09-10,AdriaP,5.0,"our waiter, sergei, was absolutely fabulous,chilled our wine... lemon and towels between courses... he is a gem!"
2011-09-07,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"too expensive.

nonetheless, excellent food and service."
2011-09-07,Tina,4.0,the crab cakes and cioppino were very delicious.
2011-09-04,wineguy,3.0,legals tends to be a bit up and down. the meal at the framingham location was somewhat better than i sometimes experience but the fries and broccoli was cold when served.
2011-09-04,OpenTable Diner,4.0,wonderful fresh seafood. clean modern interior. outstanding service at this particular location.
2011-09-03,HC70,5.0,the swordfish special was to die for!

2011-08-21,MeganC,4.0,"our food was great and very fresh. it was easy for the vegan and the non-fish-eater to find food. the fish lovers, who delight in freshness and quality were very satisfied. the only complaints we had were really about the gazpacho, which seemed to be made of canned tomatoes and mostly flavorless. in the height of summer, this seems a crime. every other dish rated from ""good"" to ""great!"""
2011-08-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"this is one of our perennial favorites. even though the ambiance was a bit upscale, the kids enjoyed it. the food never disappoints."

2011-08-10,sjlfood,5.0,brought friends from out of town as they wanted boston seafood.. they loved it!
2011-08-09,Brian,5.0,"one of my favorites, always outstanding and never dissapointing!"
2011-08-08,DiDiTuTu,5.0,food was great. close to where i live.
2011-08-05,KarenO,5.0,just overall great. would like to see pearl coconut vodka for my tonic water on the menu.
2011-07-31,OpenTable Diner,2.0,4 fried fisherman's platters seemed skimpy. calamari was tasteless. i've had better at lots of other places around greater framingham.
2011-07-30,LarryO,3.0,"the food here is always exceptional and it's consistent. we had some of the daily catch specials and they were all excellent. great preparation, with lots of choices for sides. we couldn't have asked for a better or more attentive server. she had the perfect balance of being attentive, without being intrusive. we arrived fairly early in the evening and were seated immediately in what appeared to be a small semi-private room off the main dining area. unfortunately, the small room was quickly filled with a table that had small children and another table that had a sizeable and very noisy group so the ambiance was totally lacking. by the end of the meal we could barely hear one another over the din. other than that, it fine."
2011-07-29,Gorgar,5.0,"always great. excellent gluten-free menu, lots of choices."
2011-07-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great food --as usually busy but short wait for a table. our server was delightful and attentive
2011-07-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,everything was great! food was exceptional and waiters were right on top of things. food was as discribed by waiter.
2011-07-22,herb,4.0,put us in the small room which initially was very quiet and nice and cool. but then a large group was seated and it became very noisy. not sure why they put us there as it was obvious that a large group table had been set up. thank god the usual teenage music wasn't playing in that room. no baked potatoes as a choice. food good as usual.
2011-07-21,RaquelV,5.0,always excellent food. occasionally service leaves something to be desired. pretty kid friendly for a nice restaraunt!
2011-07-20,evanh,3.0,"the epitome of mediocrity. nothing terrible, but nothing memorable either."
2011-07-16,Great,4.0,the food was fabulous as well as our waiter. they brought on wrong entree to the table but it was fixed immediately.
2011-07-11,Delicioso,4.0,my wife and i dine here quite often and always find it one of the best places in the natick/framingham area to go to.
2011-07-06,JohnS,4.0,things inmproved from last visit. the reservation was handled fine and service was great.
2011-07-03,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"our waitress, evelyn, was very friendly, helpful, and prompt. the ambiance was very nice, and it certainly was something different than other seafood restaurants i've been to. the food itself was just ""okay."" i had a steamed lobster, and it was tough and rubbery - almost as if it had been overcooked. for dessert, i had the strawberry shortcake. the strawberries weren't sweet, and shortcake was soggy, since it had been sitting in a pool of strawberry juice. the shortcake also seemed to lack flavor. i don't remember what the other people in my party had, but no one seemed to be overly impressed with their meals. it was too bad, because we were really looking forward to dining here, and i don't think we'll be returning."
2011-06-29,Iball,2.0,i have been a few times over the past 3 months and the service has not been great. once we had a reservation and had to wait 15 minutes and then were seated in the bar. a colleague asked to sub something-answer was immediately no. wait staff is nice but may be a bit stretched.
2011-06-28,FlorenceS,4.0,"had to send back the strawberry shortcake because it tasted bad,"
2011-06-27,Luv2doWIne,5.0,"enjoyed our dinner @ legals with family. great service, attentive staff and delicious fresh seafood. would recommend anyone coming that loves fresh new england seafood. it's a must do if you are visiting from out of town. never been disappointed! prices are high but worth ever bit of the splurge!!! will definitely be back."
2011-06-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,food was excellent... choices by way of menu were limited.
2011-06-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"very glad we made reservations through opentable - the wait was around 45 minutes when we got there - we waited about 5 and were seated 3 minutes after our scheduled reservation time! tried the lite clam chowder (gluten free) and have to say it was great! the clams (excluding 1) just about melted in my mouth and the broth was delicious. had grilled salmon with brown rice and seasonal veggies. the rice was over cooked and the veggies were peas and a couple little slices of carrots - the salmon was excellent, as expected."
2011-06-19,Alan,4.0,the service and food as always was very good. never had a bad meal. their clam chowder is the best.
2011-06-19,PhilO,2.0,food was good but overpriced. menu varies little from one year to the next and i've been a customer for over 20 years. i'll think twice before going again. waitress messed up several of our orders.
2011-06-18,NotTheRoaring20s,5.0,"my husband and i wanted to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary and we decided to bring our two boys (32 months and 13 months) along. we were nervous it wouldn't be kid-friendly, but the entire staff welcomed us. everyone was very friendly and the kids menu had so many choices! our meals were great -- i highly recommend the crab cakes and soft-shell crab app! they have a nice wine selection too."
2011-06-18,LarryO,4.0,"food was very good, we had a crab cake as one of the appetizers and is was a good sized portion and was excellent. the fried calamari appetizer was also quite good and more than enough for two people. wood grilled swordfish was done perfectly, as was the special wild salmon. my daughter had the special stuffed flounder, which was delicious, but quite rich. my son, had the 8 oz. filet mignon (not a fish lover), which was also cooked medium rare, just as he ordered it. all of the food was perfectly prepared and certainly met our expectations. the food here is not inexpensive, but well worth the cost. we will definitely return for special occasions."
2011-06-13,StanLap,5.0,"love legal. great food, pleasant atmosphere. generally cheerful and competent service."
2011-06-11,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"generally i have always been pleased with legal seafoods -- their fish is expensive, but worth it. this time the service killed the evening. it is clear that the primary focus is to get customers fed and out in record time, with no desire to please the customer. they forgot to bring my husband's soup, so when the entree came within five minutes of ordering, while we were still sipping our cocktails we cancelled the soup. two rolls, no offer to bring more when we finished these. no water glasses; when my husband requested water, he got it -- no thought to ask me if i wanted any water. bottom line, if they could turn that table fast they would be happy -- no thought to whether we wanted to have a nice saturday evening dinner out."
2011-06-11,DebbieM,5.0,"we went to legal seafood for our son's 23rd birthday. he had a dish that he'd never tried before, so he asked the waiter for recommendation. the waiter was helpful, and checked back to be sure that my son was happy with his choice. our daughter doesn't eat fish and got the chicken, which she was very pleased with. we had an great time and enjoyed our meals."
2011-06-10,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the restaurant, the food and service were all excellent."
2011-06-07,Wzaza,2.0,usually pretty reliable. tonight fair at best. waitstaff was clearly not that interested in going the extra mile
2011-06-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"splurged with fried clams that were perfect. started with a pomegranate martini special that was very tasty.
legals was a great as it always is; i'm never disappointed when i dine there."
2011-06-01,PeterA,3.0,"there were 8 of us out to celebrate a birthday. one of the fish dishes was so bad, they think it was made with a bad fish. the service was not good. the waitress seemed to have her own agenda, regardless of what we said. it took over 30 minutes to get dessert and nothing needed to be cooked. we left aggravated."
2011-06-01,GoodfoodAwesomeService,4.0,things were great. glad they stopped having me use a machine to check out - didn't like that.
2011-05-29,Doughboy,4.0,"we enjoyed our meal, however one of the items served was not as ordered and one of the sides came after the entrees were delivered. the entree was ordered with plantains and came with rice, however when we pointed this out the waiter brought some plantains. he had previously checked with us to confirm the order so it seemed odd that when it was delivered to our table it was not correct. i guess the kitchen messed up."
2011-05-29,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"although my wife and i have been to this restaurant many times, we were pretty disappointed with our over all experience. we had 8:00pm reservations and arrived at 7:10pm. we asked if we might be seated early and was told they would try but probably not. no problem except people were walking in without a reservation and were seated immediately. it was only when i said something did we get seated."
2011-05-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,consistent - reliable - fairly priced for quality.
2011-05-27,TRP1954,4.0,food excellent as well as service.
2011-05-27,OpenTable Diner,2.0,i was very disa-pointed with the service. i was with french members of my family. we were ready to order a glass of wine. my french guests were asked to prove their age. they showed their french driving licenses indicating their age (above 23). they also their international driving lkcenses. unfortunately they forgot their passports at my house. the server and her supervisor refused to serve them alcohol despite all the official documents with picture and date of birth showing the were of drinking age. i found this very disturbing and not a very well coming behavior for foreigners. i will not go back to legal!
2011-05-26,JohnS,3.0,"we felt the reception area was chaotic and the 4 people at the desk were not interested in the patrons, but were focused on themselves. while we were early for our reservation, there was not discussion about how long we would have to wait and i had to ask several times how long i would wait. also, i waited several minutes at the counter before any of the staff even acknowledged that i was there, they were too busy chatting."
2011-05-26,OpenTable Diner,5.0,all courses that our group of 6 people had was perfection.
2011-05-24,VisitingfromBoston,5.0,excellent as always. the best seafood!!!
2011-05-22,MarkG,5.0,"great waiter, great food - the fish chowder was especially good, swordfish with shandong sauce was amazing - can't wait to come back"
2011-05-16,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"no matter the location legal's is always true to form. the seafood is great and delivered to your table always as promised. their clam chowder is a must try, but i switch it up every so often with a cup of their lobster bisque."
2011-05-14,NancyN,2.0,"service was inconsitent, my selection for dinner for stuffed shrimp was not good. stuffing was overstaturated with something and there was a taste to the stuffing that was not pleasant"
2011-05-14,Atreat2dineout,4.0,it is our favorite restaurant and everything was great!
2011-05-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"legal never disappoints. food and service were very good. we arrived earlier than our reservation and decided to stay and eat at the bar. it was busier than if we moved to a table, but that was our choice and actually quite enjoyable."
2011-05-10,OpenTable Diner,5.0,brought my company team and everyone truly engoyed their meal .
2011-05-08,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"this was the second chance i was giving legal sea foods after another not-so-great meal. my kids both ordered the childrens menu 1 lb lobster - it was tiny and really over-cooked so it was quite chewy. the crab-cakes tasted fishy (i know it sounds funny, but good seafood shouldn't taste fishy). the shrimp wontons barely had the flavor of shrimp. the dessert menu was pretty uninspired. we will not be going to legal's again."
2011-05-08,DK00,4.0,had a wonderful mother's day lunch. we can always count on legal to deliver!
2011-05-08,HappytodineatLSF,4.0,"excellent, as always.
this legal seafoods is always very accomodating to special requests (i.e. seating for handicapped and elderly)"
2011-05-08,rbdiaz,5.0,"legal's is a very consistent, quality restaurant. a bit pricey, but very good. this particular evening, our service was slightly off - but still a very nice night out."
2011-05-07,LindaA,5.0,"we had a get together with my aunt who is 101. she loved the food and ate all her lunch, which is unusual for her. everyone enjoyed their lunches. the waitress was terrific too. we weren't rushed at all and we had an overall wonderful visit."
2011-05-01,jsand,4.0,"all of the food was fresh, flavorful, as always. i had requested a quiet table and their first choice of seating us was in the side room next to a birthday group! not a great decision, so we asked to be put in the main room in a both along the wall and it was just fine. it was odd since we talked about it with the front desk as we came in. oysters were superb-smooth and flavorful. my flounder stuffed with chorizo and crab was a little disappointing in that the stuffing seemed blended and was orange-colored. i had hoped to find pieces of the sausage and crab. everyone else was quite pleased with their main courses. we splurged and had cheese cake and key lime pie- both surprisingly light and bursting with flavor."
2011-04-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"i had the swordfish with broccoli and brown rice. the swordfish was excellent! on the menu, my side choices were broccoli and cheese. since i didn't want the extra calories, i asked for the broccoli without the cheese. they were accommodating and the broccoli was delicious. where we were seated was a little noisy, but we were able to talk comfortably. all in all it was great!"
2011-04-27,Toby,4.0,"legal seafoods is consistently good. my dinner was a sampling of three grilled fish-salmon, swordfish, and tuna, plus two sides. more food than i could eat in one sitting. delicious raw clams for starter."
2011-04-24,wabcaves,5.0,consistently great food and service.
2011-04-23,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we've been to legal seafood numerous times over the years. their crabcakes are absolutely the best - filler is almost nonexistent, the ""cakes"" have large, incredibly fresh chunks of crabmeat. we were a large party, and everyone enjoyed their meals. it was a sat, so it was jammed, with high noise level. service was fairly good, but i had to ask several times for refill, and there was a delay in getting the check(but it was very busy)."
2011-04-23,OpenTable Diner,1.0,generally poor service tonight not unusual for this location.
2011-04-17,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"half the food was burnt, they obviously do not have enough staff in kitchen, wait staff outstanding as usual."
2011-04-17,KristenR,4.0,wonderful fish. it would be great if they had better sides...very starched based. not a lot of vegetable choices.
2011-04-16,NHavenluvot,5.0,"a wonderful place to eat. and, of course, a great selection of seafood. waiters are attentive. and they even have dessert-small portions that are especially delightful."
2011-04-10,Downtime,3.0,"we were a little disappointed with the food. the lobster was a bit overcooked. however, the service we received was outstanding!"
2011-04-09,Carol,2.0,big difference in quality between framingham legal and chestnut hill legal. would not go there again
2011-04-09,ChristineN,4.0,"the place was hopping on saturday night. we were happy we made a reservation. we still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. our server was attentive and knowledgeable. food was well prepared, fresh and delicious. this was my first time dining at legal and i will definitely return."
2011-04-08,Christine,5.0,"food and service were great, wasn't too thrilled that we were seated near so many young, loud kids.... other than that, was a great dining experience."
2011-04-08,JoanneB,5.0,"legal has been consistantly great in my opinion. fish and vegetables are notably fresh.
i would strongly recommend it."
2011-04-08,BostonVisitor,4.0,"definitely kid-friendly, from the fact that they asked us if we wanted to sit next to the fish tank (yes!) to the little packet of goldfish they handed out along with the crayons and menus. pleasantly busy, and the food was great. more than we usually spend on a regular night out, but fun for a little bit of a splurge."
2011-04-07,jesse,5.0,always a memorable dining experience; legal seafood really does seem to have the best fresh seafood around.
2011-04-06,Localman,4.0,solid quality all around - extremely consistent
2011-04-03,hipomom8,5.0,"from the moment we walked in the door and informed the greeter of our reservation, until we left, service was excellent. our waitress was outstanding ... kept our drinks filled ... kept food coming at a great pace ... allowed our party of seven to chat .., brought the birthday person his dessert and the wait staff sang. it was a wonderful experience. food was delicious and hot."
2011-04-02,GaryK,3.0,"not happy with the menu changes. i can no longer order the antipasto salad which i absolutely loved. and, when i decided to order the caesar salad that had about 6 choices of additions from shrimp, chicken, etc., i asked for some calamari. waitress said i would have to order the entire calamari appetizer ($11) as they could not split up their already pre-packaged appetizer portions. we used to love this restaurant and although the food is still good and is definitely fresh, it has become a lot less prestigious; they have a get 'em in and get 'em out attitude. funny however, it was crowded at 7 pm on saturday night but there didn't seem to be a second seating like there had been for years. economy or is everyone feeling the way we did?"
2011-04-01,James,3.0,every time we go this location the bar is extremely slow. it takes a long time for your server to get you your drinks. to the point that you no longer want them because your meal is done.
2011-03-31,DarleneD,5.0,the tuna luncheon specials were outstanding
2011-03-26,Biologist,4.0,"always great, fresh, reliable and delicious seafood, done well and at a moderate price. their signature crab cakes are not to be missed- ask for a little more of their mustard sauce on the side! jeff at the bar is great! efficient, capable and knows his drinks, remembers his clientele and provides great service with a smile."
2011-03-26,Roxy,4.0,good food. accommodating staff. convenient for a night out with dinner and a movie. great to be able to make reservations.
2011-03-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent service. they even let us bring our own special cake for a special ocassion.
2011-03-23,Celebrate,4.0,"we had an anniversary dinner and found the fish to be some of the freshest we'd had in the winter months! the mussels were tender and plump and cooked in a light garlic and wine sauce. excellent wine list with a wide array of prices. and the mahi-mahi was soft and tender and because we asked them to split the entree they plated it for both of us and it was ample for a light meal. they even gave us each a nice helping of the sides.
generous portions for the price!"
2011-03-20,Maureen,5.0,"the food was outstanding as always, our waiter was very accommodating and helpful. excellent experience!"
2011-03-19,EvaK,5.0,my husband and i have eaten at legal sea foods a number of times.  the food and service never disappoint.
2011-03-18,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"just thought i would give it another try to see if the portions changed and again, they just get cheaper and cheaper. wont be going there will just go down the street to skip jacks. i love the fried clams and they usually put them on a big mound of fries, but that wasn't even the case. big money for small sizes. sad that this place is getting that reputation."
2011-03-18,DinerK754,4.0,"so glad that this legal's takes reservations, particularly for fridays in lent."
2011-03-13,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we had a terrifc, enthusiastic waiter, but he was struggling to keep us happy with our kids as we waited more than forty-five minutes for our entrees. i also had made mention in a note to the maitre d' that it was my daughter's 16th birthday, but there was no recognition of that at all. when she was disappointed, i went and asked, and got a rather terse response that they don't celebrate anymore, because ""people don't like it"". would have been nice to have been told that, otherwise what's the point of writing a note ahead of the reservation?"
2011-03-12,DaveO,4.0,"sitting at a table near the bar is not ideal...no matter what, people waiting for seats at the bar and people are trying to pass by, often imposing on those seated on the outside of the table."
2011-03-12,Holli,5.0,"our waitress was fabulous and attentive. i love and would recommend the cape cod oysters to everyone! so yummy!!!!
food is pricey but worth every penny. the berry tea to finish off the meal was great."
2011-03-12,Koreander,4.0,"the food is always fresh and delicious and service is consistently excellent. you always know that you're going to have a great meal here. my favorite meal is the crab cake dinner. legal's makes the best crab cakes -- not too bready, just filled with fresh crabmeat."
2011-03-09,JackM,4.0,the sole and polenta was delicious! we spent a 2 hour working lunch and they had a delicious moroccan mint tea as well as one of my unusual favorites (only find it in europe)tilleul or better known here as linden flower. very mild and has digestive qualities. my mother used to make it for us as we were growing up as we had a linden tree in our backyard.
2011-03-07,Kenn,4.0,i particularly like the bar area seating at this restaurant. keep those better 1/2 bottles of red wine around!
2011-03-06,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great experience and staff. waitress was fabulous
2011-03-05,BeBe,3.0,"we have always had a great experience at legal, however, saturday nite was not as good as in the past, when it came to service. our wine came late, they brought our salads and our appitizers at the same time, and they knew it as they came to us twice to appologize to us. could it been that the waitress was in training, don't know?"
2011-03-05,Debooinma,4.0,legal seafood never fails to be very good. sometimes it feels a little rushed.
2011-03-02,JoyG,4.0,loved loved my lobster cooked perfect!!!
2011-03-01,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the service was terrific, food was good and prices were reasonable."
2011-02-28,gigi,4.0,unfortunately the restaurant had to be evacuated because of smoke problems in the kitchen. we had wine and partial salads and scooted. too bad. we'll try it again.
2011-02-28,docjeff,4.0,a very extensive selection of fish dishes with varying preparations will please most palates.
2011-02-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,as always the food was terrific and service very good.
2011-02-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food and service are always top notch!  swordfish w/red onion jam and scallops (prepared any way you like) are the best of a great bunch of entrees.  the jalapeno polenta is a fabulous side.
2011-02-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"legal's famous totally fresh and only the best quality can be counted on at the natick location. i had the swordfish with mashed and an interesting ""seaweed salad"" which surprised me coming as a cold side. it was delicate, a bit to the tart side, a good refreshing green. my companion had the scallops and savored every bite. the waitress recommended a bottle of wine that was not overly expensive and fit our meal perfectly. moderately priced, you need reservations saturday evenings until about 8:30. the bar/lounge is almost always full, not because it's small. the manager makes a point of stopping at every table, service was very attentive but intelligent and not intrusive. i've been there many times and will keep going back."
2011-02-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the service was timely but did not intrude. we had little necks and lobster bisque. the little necks were sweet and tender and wonderfully fresh. i had the salmon and my husband had a steamed lobster. my salmon was grilled as i asked. the outside was crisp and the inside moist and tender. i was disappointed there was no polenta but the mashed potatoes were fine.
2011-02-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"overall our dining experience was very good. i loved the wine ""flight"" concept and enjoyed flight number 1 (then had a glass of my favorite) - then when i went to order an after dinner drink our server ""cookie"" mentioned that the flight concept was available for baileys type drink so i had one of those - love that idea! loved all of our food except the corn on the cob and piece of sausage - just sort of blah. but raw oysters and all the other seafood was fantastic."
2011-02-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the service was excellent. our waiters were very attentive. my wife and i felt the food was a little overpriced. my cioppino was ok but it had three clams in in that weren't opened. i sent it back and got two clams instead of three clams back. my calamari appetizer was crispy on the top but soggy on the bottom, although it had good flavor. some of the mussels my wife had in her appetizer were questionable looking. she did not eat them."
2011-02-26,Chrisl,2.0,"i have been to this restaurant many times, and always had a great experience. this time, the mussels were so sandy we actually sent them back. i had the hake special and it was overcooked and full of a tough tissue-type membrane. my husband who is a chef confirmed that the fish was not prepared well. for the first time, i left this restaurant disappointed."
2011-02-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"wine at reasonable prices
food always good"
2011-02-19,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"two of my favorites have been taken off the menu. the apple goat cheese salad and a special soup they used to carry. that did not start off my experience on a positive note. our waiter seemed way to eager to please...almost annoying. he also kept calling me mom! hello? i don't need to be called that! and he called my husband ""bro""."
2011-02-19,Doko,5.0,"legal seafood is a wonderful restaurant. great food, well prepared, and excellent service. if you need serously gluten free, it is an excellent reliable meal. becaue we specified gluten free when we made the reservation, we were given gluten free menus without asking, were brought gluten free rolls, and the kitchen procedures were explained without our having to question the wait person. we were made to feel cofortable and relaxed about it. very well done!"
2011-02-16,Aaron,5.0,i always make sure i eat here when i'm in boston.  love the food.  the only issue i've had is some grit in my clam chowder.
2011-02-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"this was our first time to legal sea foods and it was amazing. the staff was so nice and knowledgeable about the dishes. only one time did we have to hunt our waitress down, but i guess because it was valentine's day it was expected. we will definitely go again."
2011-02-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,guaranteed always the highest quality seafood cooked to perfection!
2011-02-14,MaineDiner,4.0,"valentine's dinner at legal. the only negative to the dinner was being seated in what i assume is their overflow area, which is a bit brighter, and there were a couple of noisy tables nearby with children, thus i felt i was eating in a cafeteria vs an expensive restaurant... but, if i wanted more ambience i would have chosen another restaurant. as this was the first time at the framingham legal, i will know better next time we visit. actually eating in the lounge area, would have been great. the food was great, and service impeccable. i'm a big fan of legal's variety of seafood offerings, and the variety of simple but flavorful preparations that allow the true taste of the fish to be savored."
2011-02-14,KevinT,2.0,"i made reservations to celebrate valentine's day with my girlfriend who had never eaten, nor heard of legal seafood. this night was to be romantic, special and unique for her. the food never disappoints, but the service was awful. unfortunately, as a first time experience for her, it was lackluster."
2011-02-13,DrMuffy,3.0,"we eat there all the time, and this was definitely not up to the usual excellent standards. my arctic char was very undercooked. bonbons were too soft inside, it's supposed to be ice cream, it was soup. special oyster/chorizo appetizer had no flavor."
2011-02-13,Mike,5.0,we had reservations for 7:30 and were seated when we arrived. the service was excellent and the food was superb. we have been to legal seafood in the past and it never gets old.
2011-02-12,JillJ,5.0,"everyone was so busy, but they had time to get whatever we needed -- and with a smile too!!"
2011-02-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"perfect in every way. we had a large group of 14. we called ahead. they had everything ready. the food & wait staff were terrific. most importantly, our group enjoyed themselves."
2011-02-08,Samantha,5.0,everything was delicious! we went for a birthday and it was the perfect place to celebrate.
2011-02-08,JohnL,5.0,new daily specials menu is terrific and reasonably priced! highly recommend!
2011-02-05,HRhikes,3.0,"the new menu was a little tough to follow at first, but once we figured it out we had a great meal, with good service. it is impossible to beat the wine list at legal's!"
2011-02-04,PeterC,4.0,"my wife asked for a glass of the house cabernet. later i noticed that the menu had two listed, $6.50 and 11.50 per glass. waitperson brought the $11.50."
2011-01-30,MichaelO,4.0,"the framingham location of legal sea foods always has the best specials, even better than boston. we had arctic char and an amazing stew with a delicate tomato-saffron broth countered by a whimsical creamy sauce with orange zest."
2011-01-30,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"i must say that the experience at legal's this time was sub par. in the past we could count on an above average dinner. this time it took 20 minutes for the server to bring our beverage, she served it at the same time as another table that was seated 10 minutes after us. when i received my tuna it was cold. she did take it off the bill and we appreciate it however i think we won't be back for quite a while."
2011-01-29,1D0404,3.0,"the place was packed at 6pm on saturday. i heard 90 minute wait for two. lucky for us we had a reservation and didn't have to wait that long, though we did have to wait. the food was good quality and tasty, but legal is no-longer a stand-out. the meals are quite ordinary, and a bit over-priced."
2011-01-29,GregM,2.0,"as busy as applebees, a little better food but expensive."
2011-01-29,lggg,1.0,"service was poor at best. the server asked if i would like another glass of wine, when he realized we had a bottle on the table (that he opened for us) and then moved the bottle closer to me so i could pour the wine myself. the food was worse. the only thing good we had for dinner were the wellfleet oysters...no cooking required."
2011-01-28,JohnS,3.0,"the food as always was very good, the service was extremely attentive, to a fault. the waitress was constantly at our table asking is everything ok. it became annoying. it was like she was rushing us out."
2011-01-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"a group of college friends met for dinner and had a lovely time. we weren't rushed, our waitress was very accomodating and the atmosphere was relaxing and bustling at the same time. i enjoy the legals in framingham more the the one in braintree."
2011-01-23,LoveThat,4.0,"food consistently delivers.

for first time, tried the $25 appetizer (tuna, crabcakes, dumplings & shrimp) which was delicious but did seem expensive for the amount of food for 2 people. ordered grilled tuna with seaweed salad and broccoli, completely delicious. good waitress.

someone needs to tell the restaurant manager that the front staff is consistently rude, unwelcoming, and apathetic. they are the service bookends, and i leave my table excited and happy, pass them, and it's a downer. someone needs to pay attention to this, and i'm about to call mr berkowitz myself"
2011-01-23,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the service was very good. everyone was very friendly and the food server was attentive. the food was the only blemish for this restaurant. 4 of us had dinner. you could tell some of the food items were microwaved/or re-heated while other foods were fresh. for the price, all of the food items should have been fresh."
2011-01-23,TraceyL,2.0,"the food is good, but not good enough to compensate for the atmosphere, which is about as pleasant as the mass pike at rush hour."
2011-01-19,thmh,3.0,"we had a few problems with our order. the bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock, one meal was served with the wrong vegetable. i ordered two appetizers to serve as my meal, but one of the appetizers was doubled. i received my crab cake appetizer and two tuna sashima. the food was excellent but the mixups were disapointing."
2011-01-16,KevinJ,2.0,"i found the offering to be average. i ordered the fisherman's platter, which i would not recommend to anyone unless you want a large amount of calimari, one shrimp, two tiny pieces of fish and one scallop. my previous visits to legal seafood have been better. i get the impression that things are definetly headed in the wrong direction."
2011-01-16,BernB,4.0,"great seafood, we like the bar area - it's more interesting."
2011-01-15,Annonymous,2.0,we had reservations for 7:00pm but did not get seated until 7:20pm. seating was in probably the worst location - table right outside the kitchen door with all waitstaff traffic continuously going past our table. so definitely poor ambiance and very noisy. food was good and upto normal standard for legal.
2011-01-09,Patti,4.0,the food was good. the wait was long considering we had a reservation. the food came out in a timely fashion. we were seated at the bar side so conversations were far from private because you are yelling over the noise. prices are high considering how you are crammed in there
2011-01-09,Foodie,5.0,our reservation was for 7pm and when we got there the place was packed. i told them i had made a reservation with open table and that i needed to be in and out within 2 hours as ouir kids needed to be picked up from a reunion.... the host was very hesitant to be able to help us...said they were very busy. i got thee impresion that he wanted us to leave... i asked why if they can't honor reservations do they take them...i told them i was certainly going to tell open table about this. well after some talking and a few minutes of waiting we were seated and the service we got and the food was just great.
2011-01-08,Marty,3.0,"main seafood dishes were very good. sides were ok. our dessert was initially forgotten, but then we were given extra ones for free. glad we had a reservation-it got very busy."
2011-01-07,Evelyn,4.0,"legal, regardless of location, is highly consistent with the quality of food and beverages. oysters were magnificent! the service on the other hand can be spotty if not down right questionable. while our server was pleasant, she was a little over the top in her 'enthusiasm' i tend to enjoy my dining experience, and the server was bordering on 'in my face'"
2011-01-07,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"overpriced, weak wine list. however... the food is always excellent, and the service is always excellent."
2011-01-02,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we always have friendly and professional staff serve us. our waiter was the best! he was quick, friendly, and just fabulous. i made reservation incase it would be busy. we arrived 30 min. early, and the couple in front of us, got right in... the woman told them, it would only be a few min. since a couple tables are opening up. then she gave me a rude look when i said i had reservation for 7:15pm... your early, so we are not ready for you. i will try to get you in before 7:15... others came in with no reservation, and we were left sitting and waiting... penalized for being early!!! after 20 min. we asked about her procedure, and she said its not 7:15.... we almost left! very rude"
2011-01-01,Hopkinslax,4.0,"always great seafood. you can trust the freshness.
they are wonderful with kids"
2011-01-01,Luis,5.0,food was great in a busy new year's eve night. server was great and very friendly
2011-01-01,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"have always heard great things about this chain. the steamers were not fully cooked and sandy. sent them back, not much better when they returned, a few were fully cooked."
2011-01-01,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"i was always a big fan and customer for a very long time. thought the last few times it was a mistake on the portions that they gave. had to complain in the past and they fixed it. i am done with legals as far as taking the family out, it is not worth the money to have to ask to get a decent size dinner. the clam plate seems to be getting smaller each visit. they would make it look bigger by adding more fries under the clams, now they don't even try to hide the fact they are cutting back. the family beside us was even complaining that there is not much of a choice for guests that don't like seafood. the only choice is the $30.00 steak which we also got for one in our party. well we will be moving on for our search for fresh seafood."
2010-12-25,herb,4.0,"food is generally good to excellent. good wait staff. hate that they play music all the time, given the type they always play.."
2010-12-24,Qualityfoodsearcher5,3.0,the food was very good however we needed to remind the waiter to bring a few things he had forgotten.
2010-12-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,patrick was our waiter and he was great!
2010-12-18,Horrible,5.0,"the food came out so fast it even surprised the waitress and everything was nice and hot! food was excellent, very flavorful and fresh and even though it can get a bit expensive sometimes, for all the food we got i was very pleased by the end total! definitely going back soon!!"
2010-12-16,HC70,5.0,best seafood experience in boston!!!
2010-12-16,OpenTable Diner,3.0,service was good. everyone loved their dinner. my fish was not cooked all the way through. waiter took it back and returned a little later with a properly cooked fish.
2010-12-12,JodyP,3.0,not up to its usual standards of freshness on sunday evening. but our server was excellent!
2010-12-05,Harvest,3.0,many of us were disappointed in the quality of the food...most of it bland...especially the schrod which is usually quite good. we'll attribute it to an off night but it's mediocre food at very high prices.
2010-12-03,JodyP,4.0,"great food, esp. the chowder. but too noisy in the main restaurant. glad we were in the back room!"
2010-11-27,TonyK,5.0,we came with our grandchildren and were surprised by the kids menu selection variety. their dishes were wonderful and enjoyed by both of them. the adults in our party also enjoyed their fish dishes and the quality was excellent. service was friendly and quick. definitely recommended.
2010-11-27,ChrisC,4.0,"i was surprised, but they were out of some side dishes, namely the polenta side dish (my favorite) and the tortillas that my son has as his pizza.

but i had the bay scallops with the braised spinach, and it was excellent."
2010-11-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"this is our third thanksgiving here.
we like it because my wife is a vegan and it would be too much trouble to cook two meals at home: traditional turkey and a vegan meal."
2010-11-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"fantastic service
fresh food
pricey but worth it!"
2010-11-25,ALISOND,5.0,"it was a wonderful meal on thanksgiving. the lobster bisque was devine, the seafood platter not greasy and the coating flavorful, and the sugar free chocolate desert was to die for!"
2010-11-21,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the reservation was just a suggestion - we still had to wait 40 minutes for a table. the food was good.
2010-11-20,DrMuffy,4.0,"we eat there often, at least once a month. food is reliable, as is service, great seafood place."
2010-11-19,Koreander,4.0,the food at legals is consistently excellent. they make the best crab cakes bar none. the crab cakes consist almost entirely of fresh lump crab. they are not bready at all yet hold together nicely. two crab cakes plus the light salad that accompanies the dinner are filling and satisfying. you never have a bad meal at legals. the service is always attentive and courteous and the restaurant is always crowded and energetic -- but not too loud or overwhelming. great experience!
2010-11-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we were dining with a friend of ours who has celiac disease and is therefore glueten intolerant. i couldn't believe how well they did at accomodating her needs and being sure her food was cooked separately. they did an outstanding job!
2010-11-14,Diner,5.0,always reliably great food and service.
2010-11-14,OpenTable Diner,1.0,the restaurant failed to honor our reservation in a timely manner. the hosts were rude and couldn't care less that i had a reservation. no reason to go back to this restaurant that is living on its reputation.
2010-11-12,JasonK,4.0,"for a chain they really have very good food, service, and ambiance. i would go back there again even though i am not a big fan of fish. the manager checked in with us a couple of times and everyone was very friendly."
2010-10-27,F00die,3.0,food was good. service was okay. noise made it difficult to converse.
2010-10-25,shelley,5.0,"great food, you cannot go wrong for consistently good quality fish prepared in so many ways. service by michael was excellent, attentive, friendly, professional"
2010-10-23,ChrisC,2.0,"they had a surf-turf special with prime rib, and the meat was overdone and tasteless. for the price i would have expected something better.

usually the food is great, but they missed on this one."
2010-10-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,overall great! best oysters ever!
2010-10-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,celbrating our anniversary here was the best idea. very romantic and food and service devine!
2010-10-14,Bottomline222,2.0,the quality of this restaurant has been on the decline for the past two years which is a great dissapointment as we really are seafood eaters.
2010-10-09,marjo,4.0,great food selection as usual. wine list was extensive and reasonably priced. many choices by the glass and 1/2 bpttle. kids menu out of this world. just 1 complaint i sent direct to the restaurant. but otherwise a great family restaurant as advertised
2010-10-07,Darrin,2.0,the food was way over priced for what we received. the tuna was over cooked as well as the rice. i would expect more from a restaurant of this chain. i'll look for better seafood somewhere else next time.
2010-10-04,WaylandFamily,4.0,very enjoyable evening. we were in one of the back rooms which helped keep the noise level down and enhanced the atmosphere. best food i've had there in a while.
2010-09-29,MarieClaudeB,3.0,the food was very good but we had to wait 30 minutes to get our dessert!
2010-09-24,PattiP,3.0,oyster festival month..very fun and delicious!! meals are consistent and service reliable. just nothing notable.
2010-09-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the chowder was, as usual, excellent"
2010-09-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,our waiter doug was fabulous. he was warm and friendly without being overbearing. he was also very knowledgeable about the wine list and pairings. when the kitchen got my dinner order wrong (i had ordered prime rib with stuffed shrimp) they gave me the prime rib with a baked stuffed lobster at no extra charge. it was my friend's birthday and the chocolate cake with candle was perfect and three waiters sang to her. would definitely go back.
2010-09-19,OpenTable Diner,3.0,pretty good. we asked for cherrystones (18) and were brought oysters and they came back with oysters again. comical. clam chowdar was good as usual. fried clams were over cooked and couldn't find the belllies. but otherwise it was pretty good. not fabulous.
2010-09-18,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"usually have a very good meal here, and last visit was no exception. the crab cake was particularly wonderful, as was the chocolate pudding cake. no regrets!"
2010-09-18,RachelL,2.0,"while the food was good- the service was not great. my husband and i both love seafood, and chose legals to celebrate our first anniversary. our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, and was helpful when we posed questions about the menu- but he brought my husband the wrong drink, made an error on his food order, and then failed to bring the after dinner drinks with our dessert. since this was a special occasion- it was disappointing to have received this level of service."
2010-09-14,Bothofus,2.0,had a reservation for 6:30 pm and was not seated until 7:15 pm. service was slow and food was only fair.
2010-09-13,itsalldownhill,5.0,"this is my fiance's favorite restaurant and for good reason. service and food are always impeccable and timed perfectly. the wait staff is always available but never intrusive. we went on this occasion for her birthday, and while we didn't want to make a scene of it, our waiter adolino (spelling?) sang happy birthday by himself before delivering our dessert."
2010-09-12,OpenTable Diner,4.0,a wonderful time with terrific service.
2010-09-05,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great dinner! once before we had the baked stuffed lobster, but had just had them elsewhere, so asked if we could have the seafood stuffing on the baked haddock! the chef said yes! it was outstanding and done perfectly!thank you for a great dinner - it was our anniversary!"
2010-09-04,Whftdfoodie,2.0,this resturant has fallen from grace with me. use to be an excellent resturant with ambiance and excellent serivce. not anymore.
2010-09-01,sanibelbound,2.0,"we eat at this location frequently however, that may change. this was the second time i have ordered the seafood platter and requested they leave out the calamari and toss in some extra clams. what i got was extra french fries. the six clams (yes i counted them) i did get were mushy and limp. i had the same experience at the peabody location. quality seems to be lacking. too bad."
2010-08-29,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"i visit boston fairly regularly and had often heard good things about legal, though had never been there. after visiting for many years, i finally tried it and was not disappointed.

we went for lunch and i had the best crab cake i've had in my life, hands-down. delicious huge pieces of crab barely held together with batter. i still think about it a year later. it's easy to see why legal has a good reputation even though i was a tiny bit skeptical given that it is a chain.

service was very good. ambiance was fine in a deliberately-tacky faux nice sort of way. but don't go for the ambiance, go for the amazing seafood."
2010-08-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the reservation was the best part because we knew we love the food! it was crowded with lots of people waiting when we got there but we arrived on time for our reservation. we were immediately seated and that was great!! we will use opentable.com every time!
2010-08-27,StArmandsFoodieplace,5.0,we had a big beautiful table in the back. we were celebrating end of summer and kids off to school. service and food was awesome. never felt rushed and food was perfect. we have food allergies and they are always super careful about that.
2010-08-26,jrjr,2.0,salmon was overcooked. noisey background made it hard to hear other guests at the table.
2010-08-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,i asked not to be seated near children and they put us in the small room. it was very nice and not loud. the cherrystones were fabulous.
2010-08-21,SethH,3.0,"my meal was excellent, but my wife did not like her's. the waiter insisted on replacing it even though my wife said it wasn't a problem. he did so very quick and my wife enjoyed her second option. i was impressed with the service. it was quite noisy."
2010-08-19,HealthyEater,3.0,"food and service were fine, but it is very noisy."
2010-08-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the food was delicious and our service was outstanding! it was quite loud though...but i guess that's because it's a popular place!
2010-08-18,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"this restaurant has had a few ups and downs during my last few visits. if i visit when it's busy, surprisingly it's very good - service and food are good. however, my visits during lunch time or around 3-4 pm are not as expected: servers were unnecessarily busy and items forgotten. also, the food has not been consistent. on the plus side: there are a couple of fantastic servers (usually at night and on weekends) and if you get one of them you will have a fantastic dining experience."
2010-08-16,Atreat2dineout,5.0,our meal was excellent as always!
2010-08-14,OpenTable Diner,4.0,excellent food; mediocre service and too noisy. sometimes hard to talk because of a baby at the table next to us.
2010-07-31,DaveO,5.0,"timeliness of reservation:seating, hospitality/knowledge of wait staff, overall service - all excellent. serge was a great waiter - very knowledgeable, amicable, solicitous of our every need."
2010-07-30,Bunny,5.0,superb as always. service exceptional.
2010-07-29,John,4.0,"as always, the food was very good. also, the service was excellent. it is not a place for an intimate dinner because it is always crowded and bustling but at least the noise level was tolerable and we could converse (on a previous occasion we were seated between two large, noisy parties, and it was not a pleasant experience)."
2010-07-29,Geoff,4.0,food is consistent. prices are above average. some food is inventive. a better choice in the area and the best seafood venue for certain.
2010-07-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,service was brusk for some reason (both hostess and waitress). higher reviews are because food was good (soft-shell crab) and was with good company.
2010-07-23,JTB1,3.0,service was much too rushed. this was 6:30 on a friday night and it was clear that they wanted to turn-over the tables very rapidly. food was ok; sauces too creamy and honey mustard whole grain sauce on the salmon much too think. don't have the sangria..much too sweet and fruity.
2010-07-17,Martin,4.0,"i was disappointed that even with a reservation, we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. once seated, the food and service were excellent.

it was a little noisy and the air conditioning seemed a little stressed."
2010-07-16,JohnT,3.0,seating was within 10 minutes of the reservation time. wait staff was knowledgeable and pleasant and service was prompt. restaurant was busy but there was no sense of being rushed. typical of my experience with this restaurant. food was prepared simply and well with no frills. i especially liked the wide selection of 1/2 bottles on the wine list as my date does not drink and i was able to have a nice wine for a reasonable price without paying for a 750 ml bottle.
2010-07-14,local131,2.0,excellent food. service was okay not great. it was a very busy wednesday evening. the noise and din in the dining room made it next to impossible to talk with my partner. would not visit again for a special occasion.
2010-07-04,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"very disappointinug and not their usual service. i've visited this established many times and for the prices charged for food available elsewhere for much more reasonable prices, i commit the addition funds for great service and ambiance. the service/server was horrible for all the tables in his control in our visibility. the manager visited some but not all based on who screamed the loudest. the manager failed to recogonize that this was a systemic issue and not just a couple tables. the timing for our visit was early dinner on a holiday and the restaurant was not busy so custoemr volume was not a contributing factor. both the server and the manager really screwed up our experience. its too bad - i liked going there."
2010-07-03,Mcelhenny,4.0,"excellent as usual. fresh, briny oysters and delicious soft shell crab. generous portion of snow crab legs, too. service very professional and ambiance unexpectedly sophisticated for framingham. we will keep returning."
2010-07-02,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the lobster was a bit over cooked but the rest of the meal was fabulous
2010-07-01,RMorse,4.0,"the food is always good at this framingham location. other than an overly friendly waitress who was just too bubbly/friendly to be believable, we were in the main dinning room and felt the noise level was much too loud. i remarked that we need to remember to eat in the more private areas of the restaurant to avoid the noise next time. key words, ""next time"" indicating that we plan to go back. otherwise, good food. richard"
2010-06-29,DominicD,2.0,"our experience was overall fair....it was the first time my wife and i had gotten out with out the kids in quite some time....the service really was less than adequate. the server did fine but did not make me feel overly welcome or appreciated, something i think is valued at a service industry."
2010-06-29,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"excellent food and service. particularly impressed with the swordfish. table for two was small and too close to other tables, more room between tables would have helped. suggest that you seat parties with young children in a specific area."
2010-06-23,NHavenluvot,4.0,"though part of a chain, this is a nice neighborhood restaurant. very good fish selection. and good service."
2010-06-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"the restuarant was packed busy due to father's day. we made reservation before we went so we did not have to wait for an hour or more to be seated. we liked the look that is the interior of the restuarant which was different from the the boston (wharf) location. it was pleasant experience to dine but wish they had special menus for father's day. also during reservation i mentioned about my spouse birthday, wish they would have sung the birthday song for him.
well busy weekend could be understood but they should focus a bit more friendly atmosphere towards the diners."
2010-06-19,jodiebasket,3.0,we had dinner in the bar - noisy. lobster were good but would like them not to be pre-cracked.
2010-06-18,LoriK,4.0,food is always very good. service was very good also.
2010-06-18,MarilynK,4.0,dinner for twelve was great. the waiter had great wine selections. the food was well prepared. the service very friendly.
2010-06-13,EricaF,4.0,"i thought the restaurant had a great menu selection! the waitress had a great recommendation for wine and and an entree.
i love being able to make an reservation online and being able to send it to my friends.
it was a great birthday experience!"
2010-06-11,RubySu87,3.0,"the service started out a little rocky. we had to wait a *long* time to order drinks, but everything was uphill from there.

they were out of my favorite appetizer, but i found a tasty alternative pretty quickly.

the lack of west coast oysters was a little disappointing, and our server didn't seem very well informed about the oysters they *did* have. perhaps listing the available types on the menu insert would be a better alternative?

all in all, a fine experience. we're there fairly often, so, we know exactly what we want and what we're likely to get."
2010-06-11,IleneJ,4.0,"service was excellent, waitress was very attentive. food was very good as always. they are nothing if not consistent."
2010-06-09,diner,4.0,"as always, the food is very fresh. had a window seat and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere."
2010-06-05,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"everything was very good, food excellent, waitress pleasant and very knowledgable. only problem was that the time between ordering and receiving food was very long. i was sitted at 7:45 and left the restaurant at 11:00. we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a major problem, but it was a minor inconvenience."
2010-06-05,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"it was beyond painfully noisy. there is no rating on your chart for gratuitiously loud.
why did we have to endure a booming baack beat ""atmosphere?
was it to drive away customers so the tables would be freed up faster?"
2010-05-28,SethH,4.0,"great restaurant, attentive staff and excellent food. we enjoyed our dinner."
2010-05-23,Stacia,4.0,"this is one of the few restaurants that i can always count on for consistently good service, food, and atmosphere. my family has been coming here for years and it is one of the few places that everyone always leaves satisfied. today was no exception!"
2010-05-22,barryb,5.0,"food was outstanding - appetizers, main course, and dessert (bananas foster with coffee ice cream). the chef cooked crab legs to order (sauteed, even though it wasn't on the menu) and they were outstanding. had guests from out of town with us and they were ""licking the plate"""
2010-05-21,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we can't say enough great things about the meal. our out of town guests and local friends who were with our group of 6 were raving. the waitstaff was gracious and charming, helpful. the only downside was that we couldn't hear each other speaking over an extremely loud sound system playing music."
2010-05-15,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we love legal!
2010-05-15,westburbs,4.0,"everything was excellent except for the noise level, which was unpleasant. service was terrific."
2010-05-15,OpenTable Diner,4.0,music was a bit much for a dining experience - felt like we were in a club and it was too loud. detracted from the ambiance.
2010-05-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"it was mother's day, so we expected it to be busy. however we were seated within minutes of our reservation and our food was served with perfect timing.

the back room where we sat was quite loud, but again it was mother's day so the restaurant was full.

coconut shrimp was so-so - have had better at 99 restaurant. key lime pie was too sour. my kids' lobsters were a bit over-cooked. other than that the rest of the food was great."
2010-05-09,NHavenluvot,3.0,"generally the food is very good, but the fish and chips i had recently was fried and had a lot of residual oil. good wine list also."
2010-05-09,cards135,4.0,"always good service and fresh, delicious seafood."
2010-05-08,Mike,4.0,"food excellent, very noisy, great service. we had reservations for 7:00 and were seated at 7:25."
2010-05-08,annieo,4.0,"as always he food is outstanding as was our service.
it is a bit too noisy but that is the only negative i have."
2010-05-01,JudeC,2.0,"the seafood entrees were excellent. items from the raw bar were both fresh and delicious; however, the service left something to be desired. our server's constant attempt to ""upsell"" grew incredibly irritating. after we ordered our appetizers & entrees, she asked each person individually if they wanted to add something to it. similarly, after our party ordered dessert, she asked each person individually if they wanted to add something. if we wanted to order something else, we would have ordered it when we placed our order. her upsell attempts only annoyed us & wasted our time. the waitress also dropped a plate of seaweed on my father and almost dumped my glass on me as she was carelessly and hastily trying to bus our table. we left annoyed."
2010-05-01,PamZahn,3.0,it takes too long to get seated...even with reservations!
2010-05-01,OpenTable Diner,3.0,you can't go wrong if you're looking for a quality seafood meal.
2010-04-19,Shane,2.0,it was so noisy that we could not hear each other. it was frustrating. food was okay.
2010-04-19,suzie2013,5.0,met a friend for lunch whom i hadn't seen for 35 years. we were able to linger a long time over lunch and no one bothered us. the food was outstanding which made it even nicer. our waitress was very attentive and our food was cooked perfectly.
2010-04-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent food and great service. i love the lump crab cakes.
2010-04-17,JohnS,3.0,"this place is usually very consistent. tonight's meal was very disappointing. they typically have great fried clams..small & sweet full belly clams. this time teh clams were horrible..no real taste, lots of batter"
2010-04-16,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we had a fabulous dinner, the food was superb."
2010-04-10,OpenTable Diner,4.0,everything was excellent. the food ingredients are of high-quality and the wait staff are all friendly and knowledgable. this restaurant is one of our favorites.
2010-04-07,sjlfood,5.0,best fish around. just wish they honor the reservations more timely. 7:45pm is 6:45pm not 7:15pm
2010-04-04,HappytodineatLSF,5.0,"excellent, as always. the food, atmosphere and service were superb. it is so nice to go to a restaurant that caters to all types of people- young, old, handicapped, challenged! and the seafood is always cooked to perfection! our servers always go out of their way to provide attentive service with a smile!"
2010-04-01,BEEKEEPER,5.0,my meal was good but my daughters meal left a lot to be desired.
2010-03-28,diningoutismymiddlename,5.0,like all legals you cannot go wrong here when looking for great seafood.
2010-03-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,as always...excellent food. great service. very energetic and lively setting.
2010-03-27,Rebecca,3.0,"our waiter did not bring our food for over an hour. it was awful! we have had other waiters who were just fine but this one was so slow even though we asked several times to order and then actually told a manager, when he walked by and ask how everything was, that the food was taking too long to come.

i think we will try another restaurant next time."
2010-03-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we made a reservation for 8pm. but when we arrived (on time) we were immediately handed one of those buzzy things and told we would be called when our table was ready. i looked around the crowded lobby and asked how long it would be. we were told that the reservations ahead of ours were just being seated so it would be a ""few minutes."" twelve minutes later we asked again and were told that they seat reservations within 5 to 15 minutes of the reservation time. what, exactly, is the point of a reservation then? we waited some more. the 5 to 15 minute rule was ignored. we were called at about 8:26pm. the waiter asked us if we had to wait very long but didn't seem to care that we had, and didn't offer us a drink or anything for it."
2010-03-20,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"service was less than desireable. we got our appetizers even before i asked the wiater if we could order drinks. the steamers were very gritty along with the chowder. my pear and goat cheese salad was loaded with dressing and we had to ask 3 times for more rolls.
the salmon was very good along with the everything tuna. didn't really care for the spinach, as it was very bitter."
2010-03-20,Rebecca,4.0,"great food, good service, very noisy, child-friendly."
2010-03-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,caesar salad with fresh crabmeat was delicious. light on the dressing vs. the soggy fare common to some restaurants. just the right amount of garlic. crabmeat was tender and flavorful.
2010-03-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we had a wonderful dinner with very friendly and attentive servers. our reserved table was all set when we arrived, including the high chair we requested, the food was delicious and the service excellent."
2010-03-11,OpenTable Diner,4.0,it was awesome but crowded.not as mucf fun ss it could have been. real shame
2010-03-06,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great food as always. i've never had a bad meal at legals in framingham. good service from the waitstaff. the host/hostess could be more welcoming. they often are so frazzled they act as if you are bothering them when you approach the desk.
2010-03-06,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we waited 40 minutes past our reservation time to be seated, and was not offered an appology. things happen but what is the point of a reservation when you still have to wait so long?"
2010-02-25,connie,4.0,always consistently good. we had a wonderful server which really makes the experience. great choice for a casual but good dinner.
2010-02-24,OpenTable Diner,3.0,the server was very attentive without being intrusive. when a problem arose she handled it was poise and grace. i had the scallops with bacon and buttery breadcrumbs. it was ok but the breadcrumbs have a strange sugary quality.
2010-02-21,Madison,4.0,the food and service were great. the reservations worked very well.
2010-02-20,Andrea,3.0,they brought the entrees while we were still eating the apps - major faux paw!
2010-02-14,muskokagirl,5.0,"we had a fantastic lunch with our friends, the service was great. it's always noisy at this location, due to the lack of acoustics. but they were very accomodating, in seating us in a relatively quiet corner in the back. the food was delicious."
2010-02-13,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always awesome. a little pricey but well worth it.
2010-02-13,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"great...very enjoyable.
wpuld come back again and again."
2010-02-10,Woodmom,5.0,"we had a great dinner and especially appreciated that they noted my comment regarding the need for a gluten free dinner for one guest. gluten free rolls were prepared and brought out which is most unusual. fresh fish, lots of options and enjoyed by all. highly recommend!"
2010-02-09,Ocean266,3.0,"the restaurant facility and service were really nice but the food was meh. i had the mixed wood grill fish assortment and was not asked how i would like the tuna portion cooked so it was cooked all the way through instead of seared and pink. bluefish, which i love in the summer, tasted off. not fishy just not especially good. the char was the only really good tasting fish of the three. a handful of scallops and a few shrimp were fine but not memorable. i was not asked if i would like any seasoning flavor added and i did not think about it until too late."
2010-02-09,KSull,4.0,"appetizers and dessert were great! not so impressed with lunch entrees. host and waiter were very pleasant, a+ on service."
2010-02-07,RickS,4.0,"it was a little too noisy, difficult for all four of us to carry on conversation"
2010-02-07,Northendfan,4.0,3 out of the 4 meals we had were great. the only one that wasn't good was my husbands surf & turf. the meat was undercooked. he asked for it medium and it was extremely rare.
2010-02-07,Along4ride,4.0,we had a great time. great food and service and a fun atmosphere.
2010-02-06,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"surprisingly the fish (salmon and sword) was over cooked as were the mashed potatoes which became starchy. the service was perfunctory - timely but rote. neither the foods or service was terrible, just not what i would expect for nearly $50 a head."
2010-01-30,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"food was slow to arrive. water had to be asked for twice. waitress did not check on us after our food had arrived until we were almost done. this when we had something to say, no dressing on my wife's salad. and when finally said she implied that it is lightly dressed. when in fact it was not dressed at all. which was confirmed for us by another waiter later. never mind the lettuce was wilted in the salad."
2010-01-29,OpenTable Diner,4.0,it was a good time but the restaurant was not serving beverages due to them losing thier license for two days.
2010-01-28,PotsandPens,4.0,the best clam chowdah in america....! the steamers and lobster roll are also pretty awesome :)
2010-01-28,OpenTable Diner,4.0,wonderful service. waiter was humorous and knew the menu. food was good. we will go back!
2010-01-27,RJS666,3.0,"we've had some good meals here in the past, but the last two times everything was mediocre.  waitstaff and chef could have phoned it in, they were so disinterested in providing a good experience.  time to move on and skip this chain for the future."
2010-01-26,jimm,4.0,excellent food. service great too.
2010-01-24,Ironpaws,4.0,"service and attentiveness declined as the meal went on. we had to actively wait and search for our server. this is usually not the norm here, and was disconcerting."
2010-01-22,RobertL,4.0,"have been there many, many times. food is always good. service is always good. not my favorite wine list, but still ok. if there is something negative to say it would be that it is not the type of place i would sit for the entire night."
2010-01-17,NancyM,3.0,"i like to eat in the bar which has a nice vibe and is never loud. women can dine alone at the bar without being ignored-or bothered. when i go with my husband we get a high table by the window on the back side. you can try the specials with the "" special ingredient"" on the side ( white truffle vinegarette) for example if you are on the fence- it was good! balsamic onion relish .great. wait staff is responsive to requests."
2010-01-15,OpenTable Diner,1.0,we waited about 1 hour before dinner was served.
2010-01-15,MrsB923,4.0,"we were a party of 6. arrived at the desk and they seated us immediately. our service was great, the food was delicious."
2010-01-10,Ruthie,3.0,"you cannot go wrong at legal seafood.  this location is nice.  the food is always consistently good, not fantastic but you know what you are getting.  our waiter was friendly and nice but not overly attentive.  a nice experience."
2010-01-08,TMS5,5.0,service was as usual excellent. mara was a great server.
2010-01-05,TravelingDiner,5.0,"food and service were exceptional. not cheap, but i would recommend this as the best seafood restaurant i have found in boston. we live in wayland and go to the framingham ls at least once or twice a month-never disappointed. also, i am on a gluten free diet. they not only have a special menu but consistently offer to make specicial adjustments to any dish to meet my dietary needs."
2010-01-01,AndyG,4.0,we came for the clam chowder and weren't disappointed. it was hot and creamy. the non-seafood eater in the group found plenty of items on the menu to choose from. everyone (there were 7 of us) enjoyed their selections.
2009-12-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,consistently good. great option for kids using open table to make a reservation. they always accomodate our request for a table in the bar area near the aquarium. 6 year old says best chicken fingers ever!
2009-12-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food was perfect - everything timed well. waiter was excellent, that perfect combination of friendly but not overbearing."
2009-12-28,Denbrook,4.0,"we celebrated our 47th wedding anniversary here. our reservation enabled us to be seated immediately, even though it was a busy night, and when we explained to our server that we wanted to have a liesurely meal, she timed the service perfectly. we had a wonderful meal and a great experience in the midst of a bustling, boistrous holiday crowd."
2009-12-27,OpenTable Diner,3.0,i think it is a bit over priced for seafood. meal was ok service was quick at first and then slow when we wanted our check. it was very busy for a sunday night. we were seated in one of their private rooms which was quieter than the main dining room until they seated 2 parties with kids that were loud.
2009-12-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,as usual a solid meal. waiter was great and friendly.
2009-12-25,JenMD,4.0,we had a very nice dinner. server brought chocolate cake with a candle for my birthday.server was very attentive. much better service than the chestnut hill location.
2009-12-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,still my favorite!  this was our second year going on christmas day for dinner.
2009-12-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we went for a special occasion... food and service were great and they made broiled lobster tails for my husband even though they weren't on the menu.
2009-12-18,RobertB,4.0,the food is always exceptional and the service attentive and friendly. the choices are fabulous (of course this for seafood lovers). frequent this chain and find it truly above the crowd as multi-location single brand (chain) restaurants go.
2009-12-16,Motherof4,5.0,"we were a party of six getting together for our annual christmas celebration. the food was (as always) amazing - fresh, generous portions, delicious. our server was exceptional - unobtrusive but attentive, considerate (six of us squeezed at the table with gifts to share, coats and purses - he brought a chair for our stuff), kept the table clear of things we weren't using, gave us lots of time to chat (we stayed for almost 5 hours). a great experience."
2009-12-12,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"if some of the waitstaff could just relax a bit and keep their personalities ""real""...diners would perhaps enjoy their experience a bit more! our waiter was too overzealous and wasn't listening to our parties food orders. instead, he seemed more interested in being ""friendly"" and recieving a ""good tip"" than what we asked him for. a bit disappointing, as i waited tables thru my college years and focused more on what i was being asked, than what i wanted in the end."
2009-11-29,Karen,4.0,"as usual, our booth (as requested) was ready when we arrived, although the only booth available was in the bar area. (noisy, but we were able to watch the bruins game)our waiter was attentive and pleasant. the kitchen once again prepared my off the menu request of trout almondine perfectly. this is our favorite place to grab a bite after a movie."
2009-11-27,tadamass,5.0,"had a group of 6 with reservation. they called to confirm. we arrived. seated immediately. prime table. lovely service, patient with the wide age range of guests."
2009-11-26,AlwaysUpAGNO,4.0,"our plans for thanksgiving fell through at the last minute and so we decided to go out with our three children (6, 2, and 4 months). the special menu items for thanksgiving were excellent. my meal of scallops with butternut squash ravioli and a side of the sausage stuffing was delicious. we also had cioppini and a mussels appetizer, both delicious. i love the kids menu, which has more variety than other restaurants and serves fruit & veggies with every meal. great service as well. one of the best and most stress free thanksgivings we have had."
2009-11-22,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"wonderful experience -- we were looking to celebrate my birthday with just a nice night out for the two of us. we really had a great time. the service was very efficient and genuinely friendly. we were promptly seated with our reservation time despite a large walk-in crowd waiting. all of the staff were great, but our waitress in particular really made a difference in our experience. she was knowledgeable, funny, and fast. the food was great, especially the crab cakes, and there was a lively atmosphere that created enough noise to feel like no one was hearing our conversation but not enough noise that we felt we had to talk loudly or could not hear ourselves. hot hot coffee, too, just like i want at the end of a good meal."
2009-11-22,SandraF,5.0,never ever had a bad meal here!
2009-11-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,overall good consistent experience and food is very fresh and good. waiters are usually very knowledgeable.
2009-11-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food was excellent, (especially the crab cakes); service was professional, timely - just the right amount of attention and quiet time. decor is very ecletic, beautiful, but busy. too many themes.
the background music was also ecletic... fast, slow, words, instramentals... again, too many themes."
2009-11-19,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"very nice. our server was outstanding. warm and friendly. very helpful. a great person.
his name is carlos c. what a gem.

food was very good especially the char fish dish."
2009-11-17,OpenTable Diner,3.0,overall good quality - love the clam chowder - service and atmosphere average.
2009-11-15,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we were seated at a table where the car headlights shined right into our eyes all evening long! we had to wait over a 1/2 hour for our beverages after we ordered them, and at that one beverage was forgotten! water was never refilled. we were there to celebrate two birthdays for dinner - the restaurant took it upon themselves to serve up two slices of chocolate cake with candles, nice gesture on their part, shocking to see we were charged $6.95 per slice plus tax and tip! we didn't order it, we should not have been charged. food was good, waiter was good, but service was sloooow. prices too high, for portion sizes. on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being best i rate this restaurant a 7"
2009-11-15,Diner,3.0,we did have to wait 15 minutes for a table.
2009-11-15,MaryL,5.0,awesome dinner and its just a great place to remind you that your in new england!
2009-11-14,AnnamariaC,4.0,have been to this restaurant many times. always excellent!
2009-11-08,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we were seated at the time of our reservation. the meal was excellent and the service outstanding. the only negative factor was the noise level was high at the start of our meal. we mentioned this to the waiter and shortly thereafter the music was turned down and it was easier to converse. however, it was still not as quiet as one would like."
2009-11-03,Emmett,4.0,"i thought the service was ok mainly for the fact the waiter didn't seem happy he was working that day. did not thank us as we passed him on our exit out of the restaurant.

the seafood chowder was very bland. my fish and chips very good. all in all $100.00 ($120.00 with tip)for four people at lunch i expected something more.

the hostess was very nice with a warm smile and sincere thank you as we left."
2009-10-24,OpenTable Diner,1.0,fish was overcooked and service was disappointing. dining area to the left which is separated from the rest of the dining room was extremely loud to the point where table conversation is difficult.
2009-10-13,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"food was very good, service slow, and no mention of the oyster fest specials, if any."
2009-10-12,DarleneD,4.0,have never been disappointed with their specials.
2009-10-11,ChickenPotPie,3.0,"legal in natick always seems to be full on the weekends and even with a prior reservation, you could be waiting a good long time to be seated.  the food is cooked way better during the week and there's a less of a wait too.  

i usually get the sampler.  this time around it was ok sans the salmon being a bit dry,but our waitress didn't ask if i was even interested in the seasonings.  i don't know if they've ditched that or not, but my sampler plate came plain."
2009-10-11,OlenkaS,2.0,"we were very disappointed with our dinner at legals last saturday.
i specifically requested a quieter table as it was my husbands birthday.
we were seated in a separate room with two tables of children under 5 years old who as expected for someone their age yelled and wined. when i first asked to be moved,i was told that there were no available tables. after a while i decided to vent to the manager at which she found another table for us at which point my family was too resigned and said to just forget it. after ordering drinks we waited for 20 minutes for the diet coke , bloody mary and waters to arrive.
we will not return there again."
2009-10-07,DavidJ,3.0,"what a difference a day makes.
went on tuesday oct 6th, had a reservation at 6:45, came in, waiting area was full, no
problem, got seated in the dining room almost immeidately. great service, and food.
repeated the process for the next day.
arrived, this time no one in the waiting area but was told i had to wait 30 to 45 minutes
for my table or be seated in the bar immediately. i sat in the bar.
waited 15 minutes for service, ordered the lobster bake. clam chowder was supposed to
come with it. never got it. took almost 20 minutes just for the dinner. it was abysmal
this evening. what a difference when they have an off day."
2009-10-06,DavidJ,4.0,"the evening of oct 6th was great.
natalie my waitress was great, food excellent as usual."
2009-09-30,Delicioso,3.0,"we were promptly seated on a wednesday evening at 6:45. our waitress, judy was calm and very helpful even though she had her hands full taking care of roughly six tables. she called our attention to a list of specials on the menu and was very prompt putting in our orderr for an appetizer and a salad. my wife ordered arctic char, brown rice and snap peas, and i the sole, jasmine rice and snap peas. she enjoyed her meal, however, compared to a week ago, the sole was not quite as tasty. the greek salad was good and the popcorn shrimp; delightful.
we will return to check out the food again.
with a waitress like judy, i know we can't go wrong. feel free to pass this on to her."
2009-09-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we were a party of 8--all family with a 95 year old matriarch, so when we were seated in a small room which was quiet we were delighted. the only problem was the temperature of the room. the a/c was so cold i needed to clutch my chowder cup in order to thaw my fingers. after 3 - 4 requests the a/c was turned off --but it seemed to be on again after a short time. more requests for remediation were made so that by the time we finished eating the temperature was comfortable. being in the quiet space enabled everyone to speak--and be heard when we weren't chewing our wonderful food."
2009-09-25,mondetraveller,4.0,the new international wine list is interesting and not too expensive. consistently good seafood (swordfish and mussels this time).
2009-09-24,JoshC,3.0,"the food is good, fresh, pricey, and the staff are very professional.  if you know legal, you know what to expect, and this time, as with most times, the restaurant delivered. i particularly love the blackened tuna sashimi as an entree. it's one of the best two or three items on the menu."
2009-09-24,MarkJ,3.0,"good food, but mediocre service."
2009-09-19,Rebecca,3.0,delicious food but very slow service which was disappointing.
2009-09-17,JohnH,4.0,"thoroughly enjoyed the salmon entree, almond encrusted over fresh spinach with mushroom ravioli.
the salmon was repared perfectly, not dry as we often find in other restaurants."
2009-09-16,ThomasL,4.0,"first off, getting in here without an opentable reservation typically means that you are going to be waiting for 20 minutes at dinner. past that, the food is delicious. your waiter might be a little quirky - mine was overly friendly and insisted i eat more rolls as they were fresh from the oven."
2009-09-13,RayC,3.0,"can't beat the freshness of the seafood. the oysters and clams were first rate. the only negative was the waitress. she spoke so softly that it was very difficult to hear her in a noisy dining room. also, we felt very crowded due to our table of 7 being so close to another table of 7 that servers and customers had to squeeze to get by. i would have thought the restaurant should have moved the tables to give both a little more room."
2009-09-12,OpenTable Diner,3.0,food good as always and feel it is reasonably priced for what you get
2009-09-09,Harvest,4.0,there were 8 of us and we were accommodated very graciously. food was excellent - especially the crabcakes and haddock special. always a reliable restaurant.
2009-09-04,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the service and food were up to the 'legals' expectations. portions were sized just right for us. the wine was excellent.
2009-09-03,DarleneD,4.0,the grilled trout provencal special was superb!
2009-08-29,Luv2stealrecipies,4.0,"food is consistently fresh and well prepared. i always make sure i make it to legals when in town. in boston, framingham or burlington always consistent and terrific."
2009-08-25,Koreander,5.0,best crab cakes ever! fantastic service!
2009-08-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food, service was, as usual, excellent. however, monday evening was exceptionally noisy and loud. otherwise it wonderful."
2009-08-22,Foodie,4.0,food was excellent as usual. the service was very slow though.
2009-08-22,John,3.0,"we have been there several times and the food and service are always good. however, we were seated in a room on the side which was pretty full (saturday night) and were between two parties of eight people having a good time. the noise was deafening! we could hardly hear ourselves think! we will certainly go back again because the food is good, but will ask for a quieter setting in the future."
2009-08-22,Mike,4.0,the food was good and the waiter was very attentive. we had to wait about five minutes to be seated. the only negative is that it is a little on the noisy side.
2009-08-21,itsalldownhill,5.0,"great meal and service as usual. a regular favorite. have noticed that prices have increased 5-10 percent for most meals. 20 dollars for shrimp scampi (""shrimp and garlic"") is a bit high."
2009-08-16,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we went mid-afternoon during the week and it wasn't crowded, food and service were excellent and they were very accomodating to the needs of the elderly."
2009-08-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the fish was fresh, the service was outstanding. our waiter anticipated our needs without hovering around us. one of the best dinner experiences we have had."
2009-08-14,OpenTable Diner,5.0,always a great place to eat for anyone...the food is always good!! service was great too!
2009-08-12,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the service is always fabulous and the food hot and delicious!
2009-08-07,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"terrific apps - cherry stones & coconut shrimp (wicked good).

terrific meals - my wife had the nutty salmon (very nice) and i had the cioppino - off the charts!"
2009-08-01,ChrisC,5.0,"the service was wonderful. we had an issue where a glass of water broke, and the staff had everything cleaned and dry within 3 minutes. the food is always good, and the gin gimlet is my new favorite drink."
2009-07-31,Bostonian,2.0,food was not as good as usual. service was good but the environment was noisy and chaotic and the seats are so close together that the waitstaff trips over you all the time.
2009-07-29,dcbdcb,3.0,"service was outstanding.
air conditioning was turned up very high but
did get turned down on request.
the quiet table we requested was right next to a
party of about 8 and a couple with a young boy,
with not a lot of separating space.
background music was ok when there were a
lot of people around, but was too loud
later when we were still talking and they
were gone. despite comments it was not turned
down. we suspected that energetic and slightly
too loud music was a clever way of moving the
clients out of the place so that they could close!
food was very good, although prices always feel
high, and wine prices (almost $10 for a small glass)
are absurd -- stick to beer!"
2009-07-27,michaelB,3.0,"i think the place is losing its consistency. i work right close go there alot for dinner and lunch. my favorite dish chioppino is always different, broth variation seafood amount different. we went there with 4 people very slow and they put us in a room way back in the corner didn't think that was needed also 1 person asked for beer and 2 of the tap beers were not available"
2009-07-23,TallItalianGal,5.0,the menu was great as well as the food and service. the wood grilled chef's selection was the bomb. wish i would have ordered it but i had the stir fried vegetables with sea bass which was excellent. definitely a place to go to when visitng framingham.
2009-07-21,bill,4.0,"food was very fresh and tasted great. service was ok, waiter mixed up final drink order but was very appologetic about it. got the cape oysters, tuna sashimi and mixed woodfire grill. the jalapino polenta is excellent."
2009-07-15,RaquelV,5.0,"lovely as always, and friendly to my three year old son."
2009-07-12,BeachLovinGoddess,5.0,"service was attentive, food memorable -- all in all a great experience."
2009-07-11,Foodie,5.0,the food and service were outstanding.
2009-07-03,RaquelV,4.0,"excellent as always, the food is good and the staff accommodating, especially important when you have a 3 year old with you."
2009-07-03,DonaldM,4.0,always a good meal. the service is always friendly and atttentive. the interior is dated.
2009-06-23,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"disappointing. service was horrible. we had a party of six with an automatic gratiuty. as they didn't need to earn it, they ignored us most of the evening. won't be back again. go to skipjacks in newton instead."
2009-06-21,OpenTable Diner,4.0,nice place for a good family meal on fathers day.
2009-06-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we came to celebrate father's day. we have been here a few times with my mom. the food is always outstanding. the waiters and waiters are always attentive. we enjoy coming and enjoying and know we can count on that here.
2009-06-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,outstanding in every way...a sure bet for a great meal
2009-06-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,there was four of us and we can all say that our meals were great. we were celebrating my husbands 65th birthday. we had a great waitress.
2009-06-13,BetsyB,4.0,we had a large group who arrived in waves. the waiter easily made us comfortable and waited patiently for the entire group to assemble.
2009-06-13,MRSGFC,4.0,always consistent. servers bend over backwards to accommodate. the check came and i asked for a soda - the waiter brought it without charging me. they know how to keep customers.
2009-06-11,OpenTable Diner,2.0,the food was good but not as good as the chestnuthill branch and the service was slow.
2009-06-06,Carrie,3.0,"well... my experience could have been better if i actually got what i ordered. the waitress made an assumption about the salmon i ordered--apparently she didn't hear me correctly and i ended up with the salmon dish i didn't want (wanted the special) and was charged more for it (i did get her to fix it). it was disappointing--i don't like to waste food, so i didn't have her send it back. but it was hard to enjoy it knowing i could've had something completely different and enjoyed it. the lobster bisque was wonderful, as was the bread. overall, it was pleasant and enjoyable... wish it would've been better all around though."
2009-06-06,out2dine,3.0,"we've been to the legals seafood restaurant many times before and that's why we decide to return to celebrate our anniversary. we asked the hostess if a booth was available and they seated us in a booth near the kitchen. i felt like the waiter might be covering a table he doesn't usually service or might be at the end of his shift, he wasn't that friendly. he didn't start with the regular introduction and specials of the day. i had to ask him if there were any specials. the entrees took a little longer than usual to come out. one of the mangers came by the table to ask how the meal was, which was a nice touch. the seafood casserole was a bit bland. the baked stuffed lobster was very good and generous for ordering the small size."
2009-06-05,Artanis,4.0,"great to be ablr to make a reservation at this popular spot.

food is good, not great, and prices are very high.

we primarily went because my niece just graduated that day from high school, and she requested that restaurant."
2009-06-03,VickiC,2.0,stick with specialty seafood items. other things so-so.
2009-06-03,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the food was fine, but considering the prices it didn't seem to be much of a value."
2009-06-03,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"i had the halibut, and to be quite honest i was disappointed. it was overdone and i don't believe the greens that went with were described as cilantro, which i have an averison to and would never have ordered it if i knew it had cilantro. i also had to order a side of rice because all that was presented was what i thought a small piece of halibut. so from a value perspective, not a great value, ie price and food."
2009-05-30,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"spicing on the fish was only so-so; i ordered a house salad, which they forgot to serve; about mid-way through my main course i pointed it out to the waitress (who was extremely nice and had great personality!). she immediately took full responsibility, admitted that she forgot to put the order in, and asked if i still wanted it - at no charge. i said that i did, but it then took another 10-15 minutes to get it.... ugh!

all in all the meal was ok - nothing really exciting to write home about."
2009-05-30,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we have been here many times and always enjoy. the service is great and we never feel rushed.
2009-05-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we were a party of 6, three of us were late. they seated the 3 who were on time and when we (the latecomers) arrived we were greeted and seated immediately. service was great, food was wonderful."
2009-05-30,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the service and food was great, my only complaint was i had requested for a quiet seating area for my date so we can talk, instead we were seating in a crowded booth so we couldn't hear each other, or talk without others overhearing our conversation."
2009-05-29,KG25,5.0,"the food was excellent--salmon and bluefish w/ mustard sauce are our favorite choices. this time we had brought the children along to celebrate our wedding anniversary as a family. our children are 4, 6 and 9 years of age. the waite-staff were excellent and very accommodating regarding the needs of the children, from their orders to extras we needed--even going so far as bringing us toothpicks from the entrance so that our little one could eat the corn-on-the cob using the toothpicks as handles. :) the children made it through with the best kid-manners they could muster--we were very proud. a surprising kid-friendly find!"
2009-05-23,Glorygirl,3.0,"we have enjoyed going to legal seafood for many years, and my daughter selected it for her graduation dinner. our reservation, including the round table we had requested were all in order when we arrived and we were seated promptly. however, the promptness seemed to end there. it took quite a while for a server to come to take drink orders, and then he disappeared for a long stretch of time. finally, another server came to take our food orders, replenish rolls, etc. the food while good, was not exceptional, and with the priced going up, i don't know that the value matched the price. fortunately, we were all celebrating a special occasion, and still enjoyed ourselves, but it wasn't quite up to legal standards."
2009-05-17,JeanneC,5.0,i had requested a quieter table and the maitre d' ave us a great table in a small room open to the main dining room--much less commotion! thanks legal!
2009-05-16,annieo,4.0,"food was fantastic!
the noise level is extremely high so would not recommend for couples.
even with the reservation, we waited for 40 minutes."
2009-05-16,Looking2Bimpressed,4.0,excellent seafood. service exceptionally friendly.
2009-05-14,PR3517,4.0,"we requested a quiet area of the restaurant and the three of us were seated immediately upon arrival. it was a perfect area - secluded and quiet. appetizers were very good. we had calamari and raw oysters (a surprise birthday gift from legal seafood). we all had salad and it was excellent. we ordered grilled fish - haddock, halibut and trout. the trout was just okay. the haddock and halibut (with shrimp) were very good. the entree came out a bit too quickly and appologies were extended. we were treated to three icecream bon bons as another birthday gift. the most outstanding part of our experience at legal was the waitress. she was beyond excellent - very attentive, helpful, polite, and friendly."
2009-05-11,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"i've always enjoyed dining at legal seafood and am so glad it's in natick, near my home, making it the neighborhood gem."
2009-05-10,PatrickW,5.0,"i am quite partial to the legal seafoods. it is one of my favorite restaurant in boston, in the us, and in the world. always a pleasure to eat there, for a casual lunch or to share a meal with family or friends. outstanding service, great food, beautiful setting, and a good value."
2009-05-10,LarryBoston,3.0,"as always, great seafood, somewhat relaxed (i.e. slow) service, and not easy on the budget. portions seems smaller than last visit."
2009-05-10,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we chose legal for an early mothers day dinner, because it was convenient and very kid- friendly. food was a mixed bag. raw oysters and clams were excellent. crab cakes were good. grilled haddock way dry. when six-year-old granddaughter didn't like her pizza (i agree), server brought grilled cheese, which she loved. service was excellent.

i wish legal would rethink the idea of bringing the credit card machine to the table. i understand that, with this, your card never leaves your sight. but, it's really awkward for all, as the server explains the 3 choices of tip percentage, etc., and then has to turn away as you enter the tip. it also interrupts table conversation."
2009-05-10,Lovesfood,4.0,"excellent fish. very busy, but not chaotic. attentive staff."
2009-05-10,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"busy mother's day: we were seated promptly, enjoyed a variety of oysters on the half-shell and the entrees were very tasty. wait staff was attentive and very accomodating. legal never disappoints."
2009-05-10,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we were surprisingly disappointed with the food at legal seafoods-framingham. we are extremely old customers, have been to various of their restaurants,and usually enjoyed the experience very much.

but on sunday, it seemed that the taste had been reduced a bit too much. it started badly, with both of our soups, both of us looking at each other with an ""uh-oh"" look. i had the lobster bisque, and couldn't help but compare it with the wayside inn's lobster bisque which i had had a couple of weeks earlier; theirs definitely had much more flavor. the fish - in an indian sauce that i had ordered because i like strong tastes - was bland...everything else was fine, and up to lsf's usual excellent standards."
2009-05-09,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"considering i booked with open table (as i do most of my reservations)they made me wait 15 minutes to be seated and then stuck us in a private meeting room with families and kids. since there was just me and my wife i thought this was inappropriate and uncalled for. i have been going to legal's for numerous years in many of it's locations but this was run of the mill and a big surprise.the food was good ( nothing too special) and the service was
very attentive."
2009-05-09,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we go to legal's because they offer a gluten free menu for those with celiac. this was one of our best experiences at a restaurant and made the event far less stress full than at other times. the food was excellent as was the service.
2009-05-08,Nance,5.0,"we got seated almost immediately and the service was great. it was a mother's day celebration on friday night and we truly appreciated the timing and pace and never felt rushed. the food was excellent, as usual."
2009-05-02,Needhamfoodie,4.0,"we were surprised there was no wait at 8pm on a friday. this is a sign of the times. legal's is consistently excellent. this time, however, i was disappointed with the wild salmon - it was dry, despite my ordering it medium-rare. everything else was as good as always. the waiter was very (overly?) solicitous."
2009-04-30,MegnDrew,5.0,"legal sea foods in framingham is always consistently good. since it is larger and not as hectic as other locations, the service is well above average and the food is always good. try going on a weeknight to avoid the natick mall touristy crowd that decends upon the restaurant all weekend. ask for mara as your server. she is always great. efficient, friendly but not in your face all night."
2009-04-28,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my only complaint is that the service was slow - i.e., even though they were not that busy on the tuesday night when we ate at the restaurant."
2009-04-28,Shilohannie,5.0,"i was truly surprised to find that we could get a reservation for only the two of us. most of the restaurants we have gone to won't take reservations for a group of less than six people, so this was a most pleasant surprise.

we had a great dinner and the staff there was very helpful. all in all, a most pleasant evening."
2009-04-26,SarahB,4.0,we have been to legal seafood many times and it is always good.
2009-04-25,GailL,5.0,both the food and drink were excellent! it was a very pleasurable dining experience. legal is our favorite restaurant!
2009-04-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we found the atmosphere to be terribly noisy. we were seated near the kitchen half wall which probably exacerbated the noise, but it was difficult for us to hear each other, let alone the wait staff. this made us pretty uncomfortable, and made the whole experience not so enjoyable. perhaps it was because of this, the food was also not as good as we had expected legal's food to be."
2009-04-22,marjo,3.0,"it's legal seafood! good seafood at a reasonable price!
nothing very exiciting but always delivers good seafood wine list is coming along, getting better"
2009-04-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,food was excellent; service great.
2009-04-18,Manny,5.0,"we have dinned at legal sea foods before. but it was our first time at the framingham location. there were a lot of people waiting when we arrived, but since we had opentable reservations, we were seated promptly within 15min of our seating time. the decor and layout of this location is upscale yet very inviting. our host catherine g. was great attentive to our needs. making suggestions to the wine and cocktail list and by waiting to take our dinner order after we started our appetizers, as we requested. our dinners were excellent. grilled shrimp and jasmine rice with a red curry dipping sauce. wood grilled sampler of bluefish, swordfish, tuna, shrimp and scallops with rice pilaf, broccoli with a spicy shandong dipping sauce."
2009-04-18,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the serves was great and the food was outstanding.
2009-04-17,MegnDrew,4.0,"overall it was a great experience. the food is always consistently good at legals, you really can't go wrong. i love the new cocktail menu!
our server was excellent. she made the night more enjoyable. if you go to this location, ask to sit with mara. she was fantastic!"
2009-04-17,Barhoff,5.0,"we had a 6:30 reservation...but i was 20 minutes late due to traffic coming from boston -- and they sat us right away. our waitress was wonderful. with the new large, dramatic plate service, our table was a bit small to accomodate the various dishware."
2009-04-17,StaffNet,3.0,"while the portion size of my tuna order was ample, i was disappointed in the overall quality of the tuna as it was not as lean a cut as i am accustomed to from legal seafood. with most entrees $20 and up, you expect a higher quality piece of fish than from the ""run of the mill"" fish joints."
2009-04-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,i went their there with women whom are developmentally disabled and we had a great time! i liked how they didnt sit us right in the open and they seated us at a place that was wheelchair accessible. the waitress was very nice to us and the ladies and no one stared! great great great time.
2009-04-16,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great for business lunch meetings.
2009-04-12,DeniseF,4.0,"excellent prepared seafood. food presentation good. service a-, waitress very busy, in a hurry."
2009-04-12,Varitek33,4.0,"we had a group of 9 for late easter lunch. all of the appetizers, entrees and deserts were very good (as always). the server was very good and did a fantastic job on such a busy day."
2009-04-12,ECLN15,5.0,"excellent food, excellent service, annoying to pay by yourslf at the table.
great ""local"" food for new england.local"""
2009-04-11,debo,4.0,"great, but too noisy for good conversation! (at least on a sat nite)"
2009-04-07,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"legal seafood is one of my favorite places to eat out. the atmosphere is lovely, the waitstaff is friendly and always accomodating. prices are a wee bit higher but well worth it! you get fresh delicious food!"
2009-04-05,jasonzmit,4.0,"legal seafood has always been the place for the freshest, environmentally-sustainable fish and seafood. at the framinham location, there is a great tv viewing lounge, perfect for dinner and the ncaa final four on a saturday night. good crowd, great food, hard to get any better."
2009-04-04,alwaysdelicious,5.0,outstanding meal and service. busy saturday night yet was not rushed at all.
2009-04-04,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we made a reservation and were seated promptly. service there is always great.the food is always excellent and if there are any problems with your meals, they will take care of them promptly. great ambiance for a couple or even a large crowd. we have been there three times.we plan to go back soon. we only wish that there was a location closer."
2009-04-02,Yummy,4.0,delicious meal and terrific service. you can't beat legal's for great seafood!
2009-03-31,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my wife and i went to legal seafoods in framingham to celebrate our anniversary. we hadn't been there since they moved so we were interested to see what they had done with the space. we were very quickly reminded why we always enjoyed the restaurant. the service was great, available without hovering. the food was as good as we remembered and possibly better. our appetizers and entrees (blufish for my wife, baked stuffed lobster for me) were all delicious. the only negative comment was our suprise at the open ceilings and the visible ventillation ducts. we even splurged for desserts, which were as good as the rest of the meal. all in all, a wonderful way to celebrate our special day."
2009-03-29,Vitz,4.0,the service was as wonderful as the food.
2009-03-28,reviewer1,4.0,"10 minute wait even though we had a reservation, and then they brought us to the table before it had been cleared so we ended up standing there waiting for them. not too cool. after that though, excellent food and service. enjoyable evening."
2009-03-28,Whiskas,3.0,"your noise rating does not carry appropriate comment space. there is no spot to check ""way too loud and noisy"" and there should be. too many restaurants keep all surfaces hard, with no fabric to absorb the sound, no drapes or curtains. that makes for extremely loud dining rooms, and this restaurant, as good as it is, was way too noisy. i realize that restaurants do this to encourage a faster turnover, but it does not contribute positively to the overall dining experience. avoid, at all costs, the tables in the open dining areas."
2009-03-27,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we had a very nice experience dining at legal's on friday night. our waitress was very helpful and accomodating. she did not hover and seemed to know when to approach us to ask if we needed anything. it was very noisy, but legal's is a popular place, so i guess you have to put up with that in exchange for the great food and service. my husband and i needed a break and decided on a whim to book legal's. we are so glad we did. the greeter and maitre d were very friendly and sincere, too."
2009-03-26,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"i have been a loyal customer of legal sea foods for over 10 years. in the past, the restaurants have been an oasis of fantastic food and fantastic service - somewhere you would spend a nice evening out - somewhere you would take your best clients and your best friends. i have been traveling out of the country for 3 months and was really looking forward to my night out with friends at legal. it was absolutely disappointing. the wait staff were awkward and seemingly untrained in the typical professional legal style. food and drinks were delivered haphazardly and the staff on several occasions would approach the table and ask ""did you order this?"" the appetizers and the main dishes were delivered to our table at the same time."
2009-03-25,Marie,4.0,the service at legal seafood is always excellent.
2009-03-22,MRSGFC,4.0,always consistent quality and accommodating.
2009-03-21,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"had to request replacement of the kid's meal corn-on-the-cob (too small!) and the grapes (too few!). however, service was quick and pleasant. overall good experience."
2009-03-21,RomanK,5.0,great place to eat always consistent
2009-03-20,bboy,3.0,"the food was good. however, the food service was way below average. we ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were never brought out. only after our main courses arrived were we able to inquire about them. we brought a toddler with us, and when the food was brought out, the server brought out all of the adult plates. our toddler's plate did not arrive until 5 minutes after, which naturally made the situation at the table a bit challenging."
2009-03-14,CapeBeach,4.0,the food was very good and we had an outstanding waiter! his great service made all the difference! we were celebrating my aunt's 82nd birthday and he made it very special for her and us.
2009-03-10,LawrenceV,3.0,"it must be the economy that has slowed their lunch business considerably, but the food is still great. the servers tend to disappear for long periods of time."
2009-03-09,WilliamJ,4.0,mira is an excellent waitress and made my first night out after a year of medical issues a pleasure. you should promote her to management!
2009-03-08,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"food is fresh and always highest quality fish.but the price is very high 

always good fish but the wait time is often underestimated"
2009-02-28,steve,5.0,dining experience was excellent - food was outstanding. we were not rushed and server was very attentive.
2009-02-23,Lance,5.0,"i have always been a fan of legal seafood. and tonight, again, i was very impressed. impeccable service; i felt like we were the only table in the restaurant. the food was very good, and this is why i always come back. anyone visiting me here in massachusetts gets dinner in legal seafood. well done."
2009-02-22,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"one of our favorite restaurants. food was particularly good on this visit. 5 different dishes, all exceptional."
2009-02-21,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"the green salad was understated, overpriced and had dressing which was requested on the side. the shrimp and garlic was ok. the artic char was good but way overpriced for the size and presentation. the cocktail was also overpriced and too sweet. (cranberry martini). the service was decent but we kept getting the wrong things. legal is very busy (on a sat. night) and overpriced. even with a $50 gift certificate we paid over $50 more for a mediocre meal."
2009-02-21,kathleenk,4.0,"the food was fresh and wonderful. the waitress courtney, was absolutely the best. she was friendly and attentive, knowledgable and a refreshing find for a waitress."
2009-02-21,Bergamot,3.0,"the food i had was great, the lunch menu is well-considered. i love the seared tuna appetizer and the salads were very fresh and well-dressed. the pistachio terrine was an unusually novel and tasty dessert, not too sweet. the service was even over-attentive."
2009-02-20,OpenTable Diner,4.0,as always the fish was fresh. the option on the children's menu of a wood grilled fish makes a parent happy that healthy choices are available. the service was great as well.
2009-02-14,OpenTable Diner,3.0,we did not like the service we received. the wine was delivered to the table after the main course (and we did have soup and salad before the main course.) the broccoli was not cooked and had to be sent back. we decided not to stay for dessert. it was valentines day and i thought the restaurant would have been more romantic then it ended up being.
2009-02-14,BobP,5.0,"as always, consistent, excellent - wondering if you could come up with a ""value"" menu"
2009-02-14,LynB,5.0,"from the moment we sat down we were warmly welcomed. the waitress was great. she was attentive without being intrusive. i noticed two different waiters at two different times bend down to pick something up off the floor in their travels - i much prefer this to them using the broom vacuum. the dishes, chairs and floor were clean. the staff seemed to work together - with a smile. and the food....was absolutely perfect. i will definately be going back!"
2009-02-14,itsalldownhill,5.0,"had a great meal. i made an open table reservation for 7:30 on friday night, and requested a booth. i was seated, in a booth, at 7:30 on the dot. service was exceptional as was their cocktails, says my fiance. the sam adams i drank was cold and fresh tasting. double bonus that they carried taylor's 20 year old tawny port, as it is my favorite and its rare to find on the menu."
2009-02-14,ThePolishPrince,4.0,"the calamari was the most tender i ever had, and we all ended up fighting over the steak one of our friends was too full to finish."
2009-02-08,Mima,4.0,"we have dined at legal seafoods since its earliest days in inman square, when you had to get your own drinks at a self-service bar, and had to pay the waitperson tableside before receiving your meal. they've come a long way over the years but the food is still perfect, and the prices are what you can expect to pay for a fine meal. also, they have the absolutely best kids meal choices."
2009-02-07,Ceat1,4.0,"food was great! table ready when we walked in-made reservations on line. waiter was a bit rushed. could have filled our water glasses at least once more.
always a good reliable place for seafood."
2009-02-03,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"the chowder and fish and chips were typical legal fair - very good. but, the sole with lemon & capers was prepared with baked filets over which a tepid, thickened lemon caper sauce was poured. this is not the same quality dish we have had on previous vists to legal - filets sauteed in a light sauce. please revert to the better recipe.

and the decor redo was was fun. the booths and levels made for a more intimate dining experience than a wide open dining area."
2009-01-30,RayC,4.0,"we usually have excellent service and we thought being in a back table where several servers and managers walked by, we won't have to ask for our water glasses to be filled. the food was outstanding and fresh, as usual. i had the special, which was a red snapper and it was superb! a friend had the tuna that was seared perfectly. and the oysters were fresh and tasty."
2009-01-28,FIRSTBORNWONDER,3.0,"as usual, our meal at legal's was outstanding. my only issue during this visit is that our server was not as attentive as i would expect at legal's, especially because it was a late tuesday night dinner. i expect not to have to ask for the basics several times before she remembered to bring it, rolls, water, etc. it also took her a long time before she returned with our drinks and then even longer before she asked us if we were ready to order our dinners. the runner who brought our meals was more attentive then our server. he at least noticed that my coworker did not enjoy her chowder and offered to see if he can have it removed from our bill."
2009-01-26,jsand,4.0,"we all were really happy with our choices: delicious oysters, although very expensive (2-2.50 each), their usual tasty and fresh caesar salad with anchovies as requested, a new shrimp/red pepper humous appetizer which was quite good. two of us had arctic char, done perfectly and two of us had the mahi-mahi with grits which was extraordinary. the 5th person, a 19 year old was very happy with his lobster roll.
we were there early, 5:30, but it filled up quickly and got to be rather loud. we were in a side room off the main dining room in the back of the restaurant."
2009-01-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we had a very nice lunch. the service was good, the food delicious, and the atmosphere / table was very gracious."
2009-01-24,Kril,5.0,"everything was great!
thanks for a nice evening!"
2009-01-24,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"the food and service was excellent. although a bit pricy, it was worth the money. the food was delicious, and the chef was willing to make changes/adjustments to our meals. i would highly recommend this branch of legals for an enjoyable, relaxing experience."
2009-01-24,John,5.0,great food. perect for families - terrific kids menu and it's pretty noisy so your kids don't stand out
2009-01-17,Norb,3.0,"the food at legal's is always quite good - not the best i've ever had, but consistently well cooked and flavorful. service is attentive and prompt. i just wish that with such good food and wine list, there were more quiet areas for dining because i always find it loud and bustling in there. on the flip side, it's a good place to take kids because it's loud, and their kids menu has lots of good selections to match fussy eaters."
2009-01-13,TitusB,4.0,as always delighted with their food quality.
2009-01-10,MRSGFC,3.0,the quality of the food is always superb.
2009-01-09,Foodforthought,2.0,"this is one of our favorite restaurants, but we must have hit it on a bad night. first the waiter gave a cup of soup to my daughter with the spoon slightly under the cup. when she took it, the soup spilled on her sweater and pants. the waited did not stay long enough to notice and we had to wait to find someone else to get napkins and we had to clean it up. the food was also of poor quality tonight. the fish did not taste fresh, and really had no flavor and was dry. my son sent his back, but we did not have time to wait for all new meals. we were also stuck in the corner of a private room with a large party, so it was loud. our supposed ""back to college"" celebration with our children was quite a dissapointment, and an expensive one at that."
2009-01-04,PanopticonPalate,2.0,"we've had significantly better food and service many other lsf restaurants around the country. our first (and to be only) meal at this lsf was our low point with the chain. framingham disappointed on service (slow, table not cleared between courses even though the restaurant was not near capacity, food (the double stuffed shrimp stuffing was definitely not ""buttery"" and should have been accompanied by magnifying glass to verify the presence of the promised crab meat, the grilled shrimp were dry and flavorless more like shrimp-grilled wood than wood-grilled shrimp). oysters on-the-half shell were excellent and notably untouched and unspoiled by the kitchen. the trash bin in the men's room was overflowing and used towels littered the floor."
2009-01-04,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had a great dinner at legal seafood. making a reservation with open table was amazing---the only way we will go to that busy restaurant. great night out!
2008-12-30,Grandon,3.0,"service was adequate. fish entrees were excellent, but my broccoli side was cold and disappointing. food here typically very good."
2008-12-28,OpenTable Diner,5.0,it's one of my favorite restaurants. the food is great. the service is super. abit expensive but worth every penny
2008-12-28,SinclairT,3.0,"food was very good as always. service was terrible, and really put a damper on dinner. this is unusual however, as usually the service is fine."
2008-12-27,CherieD,4.0,"we love the clam chowder and popcorn shrimp! my 9-year-old son loves the kid's lobster. it's cut, so he can easily get to the meat on his own. we go to legal's weekly!"
2008-12-25,RomanK,5.0,never disappointed at legals food is always exceptional and staff are great
2008-12-25,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"what can anyone say about legal seafoods.  well, i say i love legal seafoods.  my favorite!"
2008-12-25,OpenTable Diner,4.0,food and service were both very good on christmas day. the waitress was very familiar with details of dishes.
2008-12-25,Foodie,4.0,"our experience did not start out well. i had made a reservation through open table for christmas eve and i had specified a booth in the comments. as we had checked in, we were told there were no booths available and that we would have to wait 15-20 minutes. we didn't understand why it wasn't ready as we arrived since i had a reservation. the host (unfortunately we did not get his name) was not sympathetic at all and was actually a bit rude. considering it was christmas eve, he definitely was not in the christmas spirit. even though it started out on a bad note, the rest of our night was superb.we had an excellent waiter who made us forget about our initial experience and the food was great as usual."
2008-12-24,EBW1,4.0,"legal's is always a good bet. consistent professional service and high quality seafood are the selling points. i wouldn't say it's a romantic date place, too bustling, but it's wonderful for an extended family meal. everyone will be comfortable here without compromising their food standards."
2008-12-24,Usahot,4.0,"simply put, legal sea food is the place for fish."
2008-12-14,caryn,4.0,"a great seafood place--beautiful mordern space, great food, and friendly staff. probably the best chowder in the northeast."
2008-12-13,DocD,4.0,"a staple of the area, this facility is one of the best of the chain... provided you're not stuck in a seat near a doorway, in which case you're guaranteed to be hit at least a dozen times by people, especially servers, if you're sitting in one of the chairs on the aisle. worst yet, is the staff, who constantly seems rushed, and are consistently being prodded by expediters who are far less than inconspicuous with their clipboards and yelling into cia headsets to move along xyz table (we were enjoying some post dinner conversation, finishing off our 2nd bottle of wine, when i overheard what i was pretty sure a command to bus our table - when i asked the server if that was our table number, he confirmed it)."
2008-12-06,AimeeS,4.0,legal seafoods is always our 'go to' restaurant when we are looking for a date night out where we don't have to spend an arm and a leg to get a nice meal with great service.
2008-12-06,StephenS,3.0,"we have been customers of legal seafoods since it's beginnings as a little fish market/restarant in innman sq. always loved the food. the restaurant has become a very nice upscale establishment with high quality food. the wait staff were courteous and friendly-which is a pleasure nowdays. the only comment that i can make is that we requested a quiet table for our 32nd anniversary. even though the table was in a separate room, which was probably quieter the ambiance of the room was really not amenable to the occassion and our request. the table was rather beat up and there was no table cloth. further, i did not care for the new policy of having customers process their own check with the portable credit card machine-hardly upscale. thanks."
2008-12-06,Joey,4.0,"dinner was great. we started with raw oysters. legal is one of the few places where we order them. our server reccmmended the wellfleet which were excellent. i ordered the grilled tuna with horseradish butter, my wife ordered the grey sole. the tuna came medium rare as i ordered it, the sole was lightly breaded. our server also recommended two nice glasses of wine, a pinot noir for me and a muscadet for her. it was a very enjoyable experience."
2008-12-05,Emily,4.0,"outstanding service and consistently delicious seafood. if it wasn't so pricy, we'd dine there even more frequently."
2008-11-29,1stdate,4.0,"food was great. service was excellent and attentive. wait was a little bit long with a reservation (6:30pm, sat: waited 20-25 minutes), but overall i would definitely return."
2008-11-27,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my ""double stuffed"" baked stuff shrimp was excellent. however, my companion's fisherman's platter was on the stingy side compared to previous visits."
2008-11-27,Richie,5.0,everything was outstanding. the crab dip was perfect and the artic char was grilled to perfection.
2008-11-27,Douglasc,3.0,"doesn't wow you, but consistently delivers good food although a little over priced. i would recommend to anyone looking for good seafood but little imagination."
2008-11-23,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"lovely place. fabulous food.
had a blast celebrating our 22nd wedding anniversary."
2008-11-18,DroDine,4.0,"legal's is consistently wonderful, an ""old reliable"" no-brainer win."
2008-11-16,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the cioppino was delicious. one diner in our party received his meal lukewarm and as it could not be reheated (fish) he had to wait 15 minutes to get another meal. that spoiled our celebration dinner as we were then out of synch for the rest of the meal and he had to watch us eat. it was his birthday celebration dinner. first time i have been disappointed at legals.
2008-11-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"as usual, legal seafood is always outstanding. our favorite restaurant...the fish is fresh, tasty, and well prepared. i would rate this restaurant superior."
2008-11-15,OpenTable Diner,5.0,a great meal as usual and worth the price. the service and food never disappoints at legal seafood. my only complaint was the one child there who kept screaming. not the place for a little one on a saturday night.
2008-11-15,Vecchia,2.0,"needs picking up with service, food & atmosphere."
2008-11-15,Dport,3.0,"i have been to legal seafoods a few times(at this location) and was disappointed this time. our reservation(for 2) was at 7:15 and we were not seated until 7:40. the service was great our server melanie was friendly, upbeat and attentive. her wine suggestions were spot on. we started with steamers which were perfect. i had the planked seafood and was disappointed as all the seafood(swordfish, scallops and shrimp) were all overcooked and it was quite dry. my husband had a stuffed lobster special which was good but not great. we did not have desert as we were full, but i expected the food to be better than it was and will have to think about whether we will return."
2008-11-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"one of the reasons we go back to legal is that we know the food is always going to great. the wait staff is friendly, the service is exceptional, and our teenage daughters enjoy it too (priceless)."
2008-11-08,RonS,4.0,"my meal,grilled haddock with squash, was superb. my wife's meal, scrod with squash was also superb. the food is always superb with every dining experience we've had at this restaurant. the waiter was extremely courteous....maybe a little over the top. much better then rude and condescending like you encounter at other restaurants. overall, an excellent dining experience."
2008-11-08,WendyC,3.0,the dinner was good -- we had a few food items not appear. they didn't make the original order. we just skipped them.
2008-11-01,DebbieW,4.0,"the food was delicious. our waitress was great. great kids menu, including fun activities on the menu."
2008-10-31,itsalldownhill,5.0,"this place never dissapoints. its simply the best sea food outside of boston. i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys great seafood in a hip, up-beat atmosphere. the restaurant is a little on the loud side but its perfect for couples getting together. myself and my fiance spent $110 with the tip. we had two meals, we each had 2 drinks, and split a dessert. make reservations for thursday, friday, or saturday night as it is a local hotspot. i'll be back again, without a doubt!"
2008-10-30,OpenTable Diner,4.0,good wine list. reliable and knowledgeable service. nice to have a shared entree split in the kitchen. accommodated our request for the bar area by giving us a booth for 5 just for the 2 of us.
2008-10-28,jsand,3.0,"as usual, all the food was fresh and delicious, but we were served like
in the old legal days, one soup arrived, and then a few minutes later the salads and 1 other soup arrived, and then finally, the 3rd soup. the server was attentive to
water and refilling the bread basket. it was a bit noisier than usual....a tuesday night from 6-7:30."
2008-10-26,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"my boyfriend and i went for lunch- but the server treated us as if we were having a 5 course fancy dinner. he was great- scraped the crumbs off the table and replaced silverware after the appetizer, and was helpful when it came to ordering. he also kept our water glasses full, which was much appreciated. the appetizer of mussels was not what i was expecting- they came with diced onion on them, and sides of warm water and melted butter- almost as if they were steamers (but they weren't). i'd say the experience was fine, nothing special, with the exception of the great service from nicholas b."
2008-10-25,zeker1,5.0,"always pleasing, always full, always great service, always interesting menu options. a sure bet-every time."
2008-10-24,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my son loves legal se foods so for us, it was a big treat taking him there. he also tried the arctic char, a fish he never ate before and loved it. i had the atlantic salmon and it was very good. the chowder as always was delicious."
2008-10-20,washashore,2.0,"the waitress seemed to be in a hurry from the beginning, even though we were there at 5:30 and the place was mostly empty. i had the veggie box and the rice was under cooked. she did bring me extra rice, but i couldn't mix it in because the rice in the dish was still there. the waitress also took my wine glass before i finished it. our visit could have been nicer."
2008-10-19,Dhan,2.0,good for business lunches.
2008-10-18,Jakamo,4.0,"it turned out to be a great experience to take my in-laws out to dinner at legal's when they were visiting. we were seated promptly, had a great table to enjoy our meal, had wonderful service, the food was cooked perfectly, and the kids were happy. a real winner!"
2008-10-14,RCSH,4.0,legal always delivers excellent quality food and service. sometimes it can seem a bit pricey but i am willing to pay more for consistent fresh excellent seafood.
2008-10-13,TheBug,4.0,legal sea foods is the place to get fresh seafood; particularly the raw bar. always good. they are a little pricey but worth it for an occasional treat.
2008-10-05,OGTFrequentflyer,4.0,"the restaurant was consistent with the last time we were there. saturday night it was crowded and i was glad we had a reservation. the food was very good and the server was excellent. they did have a plumbing problem towards the end of the meal and the kitchen was shut down, no dessert, no meals for late comers. obviously this was not a usual occurence and the staff was very apologetic."
2008-09-29,OpenTable Diner,4.0,great food (had the meditteranean salmon - absolutely delicious!). waiter was terrific!
2008-09-21,OpenTable Diner,5.0,ate at the bar...fabulous service. it's always good...but this was superb.
2008-09-19,Jules,4.0,"our waiter, carlos s, was outstanding to make the meal terrific. we really enjoyed the food. best fish in boston. better than naked fish. for fish, legal is still the best. skipjack is terrible by comparison."
2008-09-19,OpenTable Diner,5.0,my wife and i were very pleased with our recent vist to legal sea foods. the meal and service were excellent. we will certainly plan on visiting on a regular basis.
2008-09-16,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"way way too loud in the dining room with the hardwood floor. 
way too loud."
2008-09-12,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we loved it there.
2008-09-08,Koreander,4.0,"the food is consistently excellent and the menu is varied.  on my last visit, i tried the crab cakes which were delicious -- large, very little breading, almost all crab.  the restaurant is attractive without being too formal or too casual. the wait staff is attentive but not intrusive. great place to go when you want to grab a delicious dinner without making it ""an event."""
2008-08-23,John,4.0,"always very good, although very noisy. our server was a little overworked, with several busy tables, but tried very hard to please. when legal executive chef rick valente had his own restaurant in milford, ma, years ago, he was heavy with the salt, and this seems to carry over to his menus at legal.
nevertheless, the menu selections, variety, execution, and quality are superb, and we will certainly look forward to future visits."
2008-08-16,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"i was somewhat disappointed to find out that my dinner reservation for 8pm was not actually a reservation. having an open table reservation only gave use priority over walk-ins, so we ended up having to wait another 30 minutes before we were seated."
2008-08-15,Pickycritic,4.0,"i had the striped bass special, which was excellent.  the wine list pleased my very-picky oenophile friends. my vegan/fish-eating friends who rarely compliment food they don't cook, were very happy.  the noise can be a bit much, so ask for seating in a corner of the restaurant to hopefully block some of the noise."
2008-08-10,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"good food, and server was very good. kitchen was very slow getting food out. waited very long for appetizers and entrees. the only thing that came out quick was the dessert. 
the food was good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.'"
2008-08-09,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we ate at legal seafoods, need i say more?"
2008-08-08,jsand,4.0,"everything was delicious, the 4 kinds of oysters (pei a table favorite), the blue cheese salad superb.  our friends ordered the salad with oil and vinegar on the side, easily done.  all the fish we ordered was fresh and delicious and the sides, particularly the polenta, seaweed salad and spinach full of flavor.  we asked our waiter not to rush the meal and he was full accommodating.  the only mini-flaw was that the waiter pushed their special wine offering, a $45.00 bottle whose price wasn't mentioned after the colorful description until we asked."
2008-08-04,DemetraO,4.0,the food and service were very good.  what was annoying was the noise level.  it was difficult to have a conversation without leaning over the table to hear; we had to keep asking the person to repeat what he or she said over and over again.
2008-08-02,JoyceM,5.0,we were seated promptly even though many people were waiting for tables.  the server was excellent and the food was great as usual.
2008-08-02,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"the waitress was very rude to us. we had to ask other employees for drink refills because she was no where in sight at times. she tried to flip the table too quick and did not give us the chance to enjoy our meal. she did not offer us a dessert menu, we had to request one. she only was around when it was time for her to receive her money. the food wasn't what i had expected it to be. i've been to a legal sea foods in florida which was much better. i would like to give the restaurant one more chance though because they were busy, but that's no excuse for like of quality and service."
2008-08-02,OpenTable Diner,5.0,really great food and a very knowledgable waitstaff. we had a great time.
2008-08-02,BrettM,5.0,"food was wonderful and suzie, our waitress, was simply wonderful.  we had the kids' grilled cheese, everything tuna and the nutty salmon and they all disappeared.  can't wait to go back again."
2008-07-30,JeffC,4.0,"i have never had a bad meal at any of the legal sea foods restaurants around the boston area.  the natick location was no exception.  our service (which is one of my favorite points about legal) was terrific.  the server was outgoing, knowledgable, and courteous.  

as for the food, i was impressed when they server offered to have my rare tuna sliced thin, sashimi style.  she was even able to locate a rare vintage pinot noir that just happened to be kicking around in the cellar, but off the menu.  

the decor is better than most places, and the dark lighting sets the scene.  i found this legal a bit loud, but not overpowering for a conversation.  another excellent experience at legal seafoods!"
2008-07-27,Marie,4.0,we had a great experience.  food was good and prepared to order.  the service was outstanding.
2008-07-26,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we walked in right on time and were taken to our table immediately!  impressive!
2008-07-24,Bottomline222,3.0,"i have eaten at legal seafood restaurants over 1,000 times in the past 25 years. the menu is pretty much the same boring menu but the quality of the fish is consistant.  you get good fish that is well prepared. the framingham restaurant has an advantage of having some of the senior wait staff in the chain and they do an excellent job of taking care of regular customers."
2008-07-20,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"the restaurant gave us a wine from a different, and inferior vintage to that stated on the winelist. when we complained, they protested before replacing the wine with another bottle. diner beware."
